The lack of authorization-based access control could result in the immediate compromise and unauthorized access to sensitive information. All DoD systems must be properly configured to incorporate access control methods that do not rely solely on authentication for authorized access.\n\nAuthorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset or set of resources. Information systems use access control policies and enforcement mechanisms to implement this requirement. Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization.\n\nSome network devices are pre-configured with security groups. Other network devices enable operators to create custom security groups with custom permissions. For example, an ISSM may require read-only access to audit the network device. Operators may create an audit security group, define permissions and access levels for members of the group, and then assign the ISSM\u2019s user persona to the audit security group.

The lack of authorization-based access control could result in the immediate compromise and unauthorized access to sensitive information. All DoD systems must be properly configured to incorporate access control methods that do not rely solely on authentication for authorized access.\n\nAuthorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset or set of resources. Information systems use access control policies and enforcement mechanisms to implement this requirement. Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization.\n\nSome network devices are pre-configured with security groups.

Current alternatives include RSA SecureID tokens and YubiKey One Time Password (OTP) tokens. To use an alternative MFA solution, a business case and risk assessment must be presented to the Authorizing Official (AO) for review and acceptance. AOs may choose to accept the risk of using one of these alternatives in a target environment based on the business case that was presented. If so, it is the responsibility of the AO to determine if the risk should be downgraded to a CAT II or a CAT III based on the risk assessment of the target environment.\nIf DoD PKI is not used but the network device makes use of an alternative FIPS 140-2 compliant, Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP) validated OTP password solution, then this requirement can be downgraded to a CAT III. \n\nNote: Other mitigation strategies which have not been evaluated by the DoD PUWG may include the use of one or more industry solutions. One-time password/PIN/passcodes (OTP), one-time URLs, time-based tokens, and biometrics are examples of such solutions.
