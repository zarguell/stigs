Password complexity or strength is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks.\n\nPassword complexity is one factor in determining how long it takes to crack a password. The more complex the password, the greater the number of possible combinations that need to be tested before the password is compromised.\n\nSpecial characters are those characters that are not alphanumeric. Examples include: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ *.",
