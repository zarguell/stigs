When transmitting data, applications need to leverage transmission protection mechanisms, such as TLS, TLS VPNs, or IPsec.\n\nCommunication paths outside the physical protection of a controlled boundary are exposed to the possibility of interception and modification. Protecting the confidentiality and integrity of organizational information can be accomplished by physical means (e.g., employing physical distribution systems) or by logical means (e.g., employing cryptographic techniques). If physical means of protection are employed, then logical means (cryptography) do not have to be employed, and vice versa.\n\nSatisfies: PP-MDM-431009 / SRG-APP-000439, SRG-APP-000440\n\nSFR ID: FMT_SMF.1.1(2) b / SC-8, SC-8 (1), SC-8 (2)", "FalsePositives": "", "FalseNegatives": "", "Documentable": "false", "Mitigations": "", "SeverityOverrideGuidance": "", "PotentialImpacts": "", "ThirdPartyTools": "", "MitigationControl": "", "Responsibility": "", "IAControls": "", "CheckText": "Talk to the site UEM Administrator to confirm the SQL server has been configured to connect to UEM using the TLS connection or confirm during a review of the SQL server.\n\nIf the SQL server has not been configured to connect to UEM using the TLS connection, this is a finding.", "FixText": "Confirm the Administrator has configured the SQL server to connect to UEM using the TLS connection.", "CCI": "SV-111889,V-102927,CCI-002418,CCI-002420,CCI-002421,CCI-002422"}, {"VulnID": "V-224387", "RuleID": "SV-224387r604136_rule", "StigID": "BUEM-00-200280", "Severity": "medium", "Cat": "CAT II", "Classification": "", "GroupTitle": "PP-MDM-991000", "RuleTitle": "The BlackBerry UEM server Blackberry Web Services must not be authorized access from external sources unnecessarily.", "Description": "<VulnDiscussion>By limiting access to the subset of Administrator UI functions to internal administrators, the risk of an attacker developing a custom application to administer UEM potentially changing pre-configuration items in UEM is reduced\n\nSFR ID: FMT_SMF.1.1(2) b / CM-7 b\n\nSatisfies:  SRG-APP-000142</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>", "VulnDiscussion": "By limiting access to the subset of Administrator UI functions to internal administrators, the risk of an attacker developing a custom application to administer UEM potentially changing pre-configuration items in UEM is reduced\n\nSFR ID: FMT_SMF.1.1(2) b / CM-7 b\n\nSatisfies:  SRG-APP-000142", "FalsePositives": "", "FalseNegatives": "", "Documentable": "false", "Mitigations": "", "SeverityOverrideGuidance": "", "PotentialImpacts": "", "ThirdPartyTools": "", "MitigationControl": "", "Responsibility": "", "IAControls": "", "CheckText": "Verify BlackBerry UEM server Blackberry Web Services has not been configured to allow access from external sources unnecessarily.\n\n1.
