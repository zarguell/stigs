The Network Analysis Policy List pop-up window appears.\n\nVerify that a policy exists. By default, the system uses the Balanced Security and Connectivity network analysis policy.\n\nNote: A network analysis policy governs how traffic is decoded and preprocessed so that it can be further evaluated for anomalous traffic that might signal an intrusion attempt. An intrusion policy uses intrusion and preprocessor rules (sometimes referred to collectively as intrusion rules) to examine the decoded packets for attacks based on patterns. Both network analysis and intrusion policies are invoked by a parent access control policy. As the system analyzes traffic, the network analysis phase occurs before and separately from the intrusion prevention phase. \n-------------------------------------------------\nVerify logging for connection events is enabled.\n\nStep 1: Navigate to Configuration >> ASA Firepower Configuration >> Policies >> Access Control Policy.
