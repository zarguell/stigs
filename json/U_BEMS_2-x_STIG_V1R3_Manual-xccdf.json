This is usually achieved through the use of Transport Layer Security (TLS).\n\nTransmission of data can take place between the application server and a large number of devices/applications external to the application server. Examples are a web client used by a user, a backend database, a log server, or other application servers in an application server cluster.\n\nIf data is transmitted unencrypted, the data then becomes vulnerable to disclosure. The disclosure may reveal user identifier/password combinations, website code revealing business logic, or other user personal information.\n\nFIPS 140-2 approved TLS versions include TLS V1.0 or greater.\n\nTLS must be enabled and non-FIPS-approved SSL versions must be disabled.
