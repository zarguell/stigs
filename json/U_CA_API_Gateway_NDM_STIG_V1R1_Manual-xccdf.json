For each network device, known and potential DoS attacks must be identified and solutions for each type implemented. A variety of technologies exist to limit or, in some cases, eliminate the effects of DoS attacks (e.g., limiting processes or restricting the number of sessions the device opens at one time). Employing increased capacity and bandwidth, combined with service redundancy, may reduce the susceptibility to some DoS attacks.\n\nThe security safeguards cannot be defined at the DoD level because they vary according to the capabilities of the individual network devices and the security controls applied on the adjacent networks (for example, firewalls performing packet filtering to block DoS attacks).", "FalsePositives": "", "FalseNegatives": "", "Documentable": "false", "Mitigations": "", "SeverityOverrideGuidance": "", "PotentialImpacts": "", "ThirdPartyTools": "", "MitigationControl": "", "Responsibility": "", "IAControls": "", "CheckText": "Verify the CA API Gateway drops packets by default and only puts non-Gateway services on trusted interfaces.\n \nCheck for the following lines in \"/etc/sysconfig/iptables\":\n:INPUT DROP [0:0]\n:FORWARD DROP [0:0]\n[0:0] -A INPUT -i eth0 -p udp -m udp --dport 53 -j ACCEPT\n[0:0] -A INPUT -i eth2 -p udp -m udp --dport 53 -j ACCEPT\n[0:0] -A INPUT -i eth3 -p udp -m udp --dport 53 -j ACCEPT\n[0:0] -A INPUT -i eth0 -p udp -m udp --dport 123 -j ACCEPT\n[0:0] -A INPUT -i eth2 -p udp -m udp --dport 123 -j ACCEPT\n[0:0] -A INPUT -i eth3 -p udp -m udp --dport 123 -j ACCEPT\n[0:0] -A INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 3306 -j ACCEPT\n[0:0] -A INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT\n \nCheck for the following lines in \"/etc/sysconfig/ip6tables\":\n:INPUT DROP [0:0]\n[0:0] -A INPUT -i eth0 -p udp -m udp --dport 53 -j ACCEPT\n[0:0] -A INPUT -i eth2 -p udp -m udp --dport 53 -j ACCEPT\n[0:0] -A INPUT -i eth3 -p udp -m udp --dport 53 -j ACCEPT\n[0:0] -A INPUT -i eth0 -p udp -m udp --dport 123 -j ACCEPT\n[0:0] -A INPUT -i eth2 -p udp -m udp --dport 123 -j ACCEPT\n[0:0] -A INPUT -i eth3 -p udp -m udp --dport 123 -j ACCEPT\n[0:0] -A INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 3306 -j ACCEPT\n[0:0] -A INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT\n \nIf the CA API Gateway does not drop packets by default or puts non-Gateway services on untrusted interfaces, this is a finding.\n \nVerify the CA API Gateway logs and drops TCP packets with bad flags.\n \nCheck for the following lines in \"/etc/sysconfig/iptables\":\n[0:0] -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags FIN,SYN,RST,PSH,ACK,URG FIN,PSH,URG -j badflags\n[0:0] -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags FIN,SYN,RST,PSH,ACK,URG FIN,SYN,RST,PSH,ACK,URG -j badflags\n[0:0] -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags FIN,SYN,RST,PSH,ACK,URG FIN,SYN,RST,ACK,URG -j badflags\n[0:0] -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags FIN,SYN,RST,PSH,ACK,URG NONE -j badflags\n[0:0] -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags SYN,RST SYN,RST -j badflags\n[0:0] -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags FIN,SYN FIN,SYN -j badflags\n[0:0] -A badflags -m limit --limit 15/min -j LOG --log-prefix \"Badflags:\"\n[0:0] -A badflags -j DROP\n \nCheck for the following lines in \"/etc/sysconfig/ip6tables\":\n[0:0] -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags FIN,SYN,RST,PSH,ACK,URG FIN,PSH,URG -j badflags6\n[0:0] -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags FIN,SYN,RST,PSH,ACK,URG FIN,SYN,RST,PSH,ACK,URG -j badflags6\n[0:0] -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags FIN,SYN,RST,PSH,ACK,URG FIN,SYN,RST,ACK,URG -j badflags6\n[0:0] -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags FIN,SYN,RST,PSH,ACK,URG NONE -j badflags6\n[0:0] -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags SYN,RST SYN,RST -j badflags6\n[0:0] -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags FIN,SYN FIN,SYN -j badflags6\n[0:0] -A badflags6 -m limit --limit 15/min -j LOG --log-prefix \"Badflags6:\"\n[0:0] -A badflags6 -j DROP\n \nIf the CA API Gateway does not log and drop TCP packets with bad flags, this is a finding.\n \nVerify the CA API Gateway only allows certain ICMPs and rate limits pings.\n \nCheck for the following lines in \"/etc/sysconfig/iptables\":\n[0:0] -A INPUT -p icmp -m icmp --icmp-type 0 -j ACCEPT\n[0:0] -A INPUT -p icmp -m icmp --icmp-type 3 -j ACCEPT\n[0:0] -A INPUT -p icmp -m icmp --icmp-type 11 -j ACCEPT\n[0:0] -A INPUT -p icmp -m icmp --icmp-type 8 -m limit --limit 2/sec -j ACCEPT\n[0:0] -A INPUT -p icmp -j badflags\n[0:0] -A OUTPUT -p icmp -m state --state INVALID -j DROP\n \nCheck for the following lines in \"/etc/sysconfig/ip6tables\":\n[0:0] -A INPUT -p icmpv6 -m icmpv6 --icmpv6-type 1 -j ACCEPT\n[0:0] -A INPUT -p icmpv6 -m icmpv6 --icmpv6-type 3 -j ACCEPT\n[0:0] -A INPUT -p icmpv6 -m icmpv6 --icmpv6-type 129 -j ACCEPT\n[0:0] -A INPUT -p icmpv6 -m icmpv6 --icmpv6-type 128 -m limit --limit 2/sec -j ACCEPT\n[0:0] -A INPUT -p icmpv6 -m icmpv6 --icmpv6-type 133 -j ACCEPT\n[0:0] -A INPUT -p icmpv6 -m icmpv6 --icmpv6-type 134 -j ACCEPT\n[0:0] -A INPUT -p icmpv6 -m icmpv6 --icmpv6-type 135 -j ACCEPT\n[0:0] -A INPUT -p icmpv6 -m icmpv6 --icmpv6-type 136 -j ACCEPT\n[0:0] -A INPUT -p icmpv6 -m icmpv6 --icmpv6-type 137 -j ACCEPT\n[0:0] -A INPUT -p icmpv6 -j badflags6\n \nIf the CA API Gateway does not only allow certain ICMPs and rate limits pings, this is a finding.", "FixText": "If the \"iptables\" file is not consistent, replace it with one from the distribution RPM.
