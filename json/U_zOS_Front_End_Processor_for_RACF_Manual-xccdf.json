Enable FIPS - Select this option to enforce the use of FIPS-approved cryptography. You must also enable the Windows security option from the operating system group policy, System Cryptography: Use FIPS-compliant algorithms for encryption, hashing, and signing. Otherwise, Citrix Receiver for Windows might fail to connect to published applications and desktops.\n5. From the Allow TLS Servers drop-down, select the port number. Ensure that Citrix Receiver connects only to a specified server by using a comma-separated list. Wildcards and port numbers can be specified. For example, *.citrix.com:4433 allows connections to any server whose common name ends with .citrix.com on port 4433. The issuer of the certificate asserts the accuracy of the information in a security certificate. If Citrix Receiver does not recognize and trust the issuer, the connection is rejected.\n6.
