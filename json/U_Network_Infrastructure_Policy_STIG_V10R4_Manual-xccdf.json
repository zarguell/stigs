Commercial transport services procured as an alternative to the DISN-provided transport requires compliance with this issuance or DoD CIO review and approval.\u201d\n\nBased on the use cases below, verify written approval has been obtained from the Office of the DoD CIO or verify a renewal request has been appropriately submitted. There are three basic use cases for an ISP connection.  \n\nUse case (1): An ISP connection that originates from an approved DISN infrastructure source (includes IAP connections at the DECCs). A DoDIN Waiver is required for a CC/S/A to connect the unclassified DISN to an ISP. These connection requests must come to the Waiver Panel with a Component CIO endorsement of the requirement. These connections should not be provisioned and put into use until waived. Expired waivers pending renewal from the OSD DoDIN Waiver Panel may be downgraded to a Severity 3 category, if proof of a requested renewal can be verified. A DISN enclave that cannot prove DoDIN Waiver approval for the ISP connection is a Severity 1 category. Note: If discovered during a CCRI assessment, the review team lead will immediately report the unapproved ISP connection to the USCYBERCOM (301-688-3585) and the Connection Approval Office (301-225-2900/2901). USCYBERCOM will direct the connection be immediately disconnected. \n\nUse Case (2): An ISP connection to a Stand Alone Enclave (physically and logically separated from any DISN connection) requires DoDIN Waiver approval prior to connection. The Stand Alone Enclave must have an AO issued ATO and the connection must be logically and physically separated from the DISN. An unapproved ISP connection in this use case will be assigned a Severity 3 category.\n\nUse Case (3): An ISP connection to a non-DoD network (such as a contractor-owned infrastructure) co-located on the same premises as the DoD network. The non-DoD network is physically and logically separated from any DoD IP network. Furthermore, it is not connected to any DoD IP network. The non-DoD network infrastructure is not DoD funded nor is it operated or administered by DoD military or civilian personnel. In addition, the non-DoD network with the ISP connection is not storing, processing, or transmitting any DoD data. For such a network as defined herein, a DoDIN Waiver approval is not required for deploying a connection to an ISP. However, the AO must perform and have on file a risk assessment endorsed by the facility or installation command.\n\nIf any of the above use cases are applicable, and written approval has been not been obtained from the Office of the DoD CIO or a renewal request has not been submitted, this is a finding.", "FixText": "Written mission justification approval must be obtained from the Office of the DoD CIO prior to establishing a direct connection to the Internet via commercial service provider outside DoD CIO approved Internet access points (e.g. DISA IAP, Cloud Access Point, NIPRnet Federated Gateway, DREN IAP, etc.).", "CCI": "V-8051,SV-8537,CCI-001101,CCI-001121"}, {"VulnID": "V-251334", "RuleID": "SV-251334r805957_rule", "StigID": "NET0140", "Severity": "low", "Cat": "CAT III", "Classification": "", "GroupTitle": "NET0140", "RuleTitle": "The connection between the Channel Service Unit/Data Service Unit (CSU/DSU) and the Local Exchange Carriers (LEC) data service jack (i.e., demarc) as well as any service provider premise equipment must be located in a secure environment.", "Description": "<VulnDiscussion>DOD leased lines carry an aggregate of sensitive and non-sensitive data; therefore unauthorized access must be restricted.

Software updates fix bugs in the IDPS software or add new functionality, while signature updates add new detection capabilities or refine existing detection capabilities (e.g., reducing false positives). For many IDPSs, signature updates cause program code to be altered or replaced, so they are really a specialized form of software update. For other IDPSs, signatures are not written in code, so a signature update is a change to the configuration data for the IDPS. \n\nSoftware updates can include any or all IDPS components, including sensors, agents, management servers, and consoles. Software updates for sensors and management servers, particularly appliance-based devices, are often applied by replacing an existing IDPS CD with a new one and rebooting the device. Many IDPSs run the software directly from the CD, so that no software installation is required. Other components, such as agents, require an administrator to install software or apply patches, either manually on each host or automatically through IDPS management software. Some vendors make software and signature updates available for download from their Web sites or other servers; often, the administrator interfaces for IDPSs have features for downloading and installing such updates. \n\nAdministrators should verify the integrity of updates before applying them, because updates could have been inadvertently or intentionally altered or replaced. The recommended verification method depends on the update's format, as follows:\n\nFiles downloaded from a Web site or FTP site. Administrators should compare file checksums provided by the vendor with checksums that they compute for the downloaded files. \n\nUpdate downloaded automatically through the IDPS user interface. If an update is downloaded as a single file or a set of files, either checksums provided by the vendor should be compared to checksums generated by the administrator, or the IDPS user interface itself should perform some sort of integrity check. In some cases, updates might be downloaded and installed as one action, precluding checksum verification; the IDPS user interface should check each update's integrity as part of this. \n\nRemovable media (e.g., CD, DVD). Vendors may not provide a specific method for customers to verify the legitimacy of removable media apparently sent by the vendors. If media verification is a concern, administrators should contact their vendors to determine how the media can be verified, such as comparing vendor-provided checksums to checksums computed for files on the media, or verifying digital signatures on the media's contents to ensure they are valid.
