Application inspection all enforces conformance against published RFCs.\n\nSome applications embed an IP address in the packet that needs to match the source address that is normally translated when it goes through the firewall. Enabling application inspection for a service that embeds IP addresses, the firewall translates embedded addresses and updates any checksum or other fields that are affected by the translation. Enabling application inspection for a service that uses dynamically assigned ports, the firewall monitors sessions to identify the dynamic port assignments, and permits data exchange on these ports for the duration of the specific session. \n", "FalsePositives": "", "FalseNegatives": "", "Documentable": "false", "Mitigations": "", "SeverityOverrideGuidance": "", "PotentialImpacts": "", "ThirdPartyTools": "", "MitigationControl": "", "Responsibility": "", "IAControls": "", "CheckText": "Review the firewall configuration to verify that inspection for applications deployed within the network is being performed on all interfaces.\nIf the firewall is not configured to inspect all inbound and outbound traffic at the application layer, this is a finding.", "FixText": "Configure the firewall to inspect all inbound and outbound traffic at the application layer.", "CCI": "SV-110207,V-101103,CCI-000366"}, {"VulnID": "V-223012", "RuleID": "SV-223012r604133_rule", "StigID": "SRG-NET-000364-FW-000041", "Severity": "medium", "Cat": "CAT II", "Classification": "", "GroupTitle": "SRG-NET-000364", "RuleTitle": "The firewall must be configured to inspect all inbound and outbound IPv6 traffic for unknown or out-of-order extension headers.", "Description": "<VulnDiscussion>IPv6 packets with unknown extension headers as well as out-of-order headers can create denial-of-service attacks for other networking components as well as host devices.
