This requirement is not applicable to Arista switches when not used as an access switch.\n\n802.1X must be configured on any interface where there is an applicable endpoint device connected. This is demonstrated by viewing the running-config via the \"show dot1x all\" command and validating the following lines are present in the configuration:\n\nDot1X Information for Ethernet[X]\n--------------------------------------------\nPortControl : auto\nHostMode : single-host\nQuietPeriod : [value]\nTxPeriod : [value]\nReauthPeriod : 3600 seconds\nMaxReauthReq : 2\n\n!\n\n802.1X must also be globally enabled on the switch using the \"dot1x system-auth-control\" command from the configuration mode interface. When this is configured, the following line will be visible in the running-config:\n\ndot1x-system-auth-control\n\n802.1X is dependent on a properly configured RADIUS server for authentication. Refer to the RADIUS configuration example for validation of properly configured AAA services. Additionally, the user must specify to use the RADIUS server as an 802.1X authenticator with the \"aaa authentication dot1x default group [radius]\" command from the configuration mode interface, replacing the bracketed variable with either the group name of the RADIUS server group or leaving it as is to authenticate against all RADIUS servers. When properly configured, the following line is visible in the running-config:\n\naaa authentication dot1x default group radius\n\nIf 802.1X is not configured on necessary ports or is not globally enabled on the switch, or if it is not set to authenticate supplicants via RADIUS, this is a finding.",
