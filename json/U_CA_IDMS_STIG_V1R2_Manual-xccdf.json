The RHDCSRTT module allows users to define the different functions and applications as type EXTERNAL to make them visible to the ESM so that they can be secured. These load modules are used by the IDMS Central Version to understand how access to the IDMS environment is to be controlled. Again, it is not sufficient to merely define what should be secured via the RHDCSRTT module, these functions must be secured through the ESM. \n\nThe security of the assembler macros and the security load modules must be upheld to protect the environment. Use the ESM to enact Dataset Level Security on the CAGJMAC macro library where the IDMS assembler macros reside.

If granularly controlling user access in batch to local mode is required and EXIT 14 is not set up in the RHDCUXIT module, see the IDMS documentation. Use EXIT 14 to decide which database verbs to protect. Access is protected by associating the verbs with a security resource in the RHDCSRTT, which is protected by the ESM. This is an exit that must be compiled into the RHDCUXIT load module. This exit is called at the time of a database verb being called and allows users to define which verbs are secured and how they are secured by issued Security Checks based on the user making the calls. This allows a user to choose which verbs are privileged and who is able to access them. As before, the verbs are secured by associating them with a defined access type in the RHDCSRTT, module which then needs to be secured by the ESM.
