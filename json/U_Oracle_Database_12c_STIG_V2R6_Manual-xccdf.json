For more information, see \"SQL standard authorization\" in the Java DB Developer's Guide.\nLimitations\n\nThe following limitations apply to the REVOKE statement:\n\nTable-level privileges:\n\nAll of the table-level privilege types for a specified grantee and table ID are stored in one row in the SYSTABLEPERMS system table. For example, when user2 is granted the SELECT and DELETE privileges on table user1.t1, a row is added to the SYSTABLEPERMS table. The GRANTEE field contains user2 and the TABLEID contains user1.t1. The SELECTPRIV and DELETEPRIV fields are set to Y. The remaining privilege type fields are set to N.\n\nWhen a grantee creates an object that relies on one of the privilege types, the Derby engine tracks the dependency of the object on the specific row in the SYSTABLEPERMS table. For example, user2 creates the view v1 by using the statement SELECT * FROM user1.t1; the dependency manager tracks the dependency of view v1 on the row in SYSTABLEPERMS for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1). The dependency manager knows only that the view is dependent on a privilege type in that specific row but does not track exactly which privilege type the view is dependent on.\n\nWhen a REVOKE statement for a table-level privilege is issued for a grantee and table ID, all of the objects that are dependent on the grantee and table ID are dropped. For example, if user1 revokes the DELETE privilege on table t1 from user2, the row in SYSTABLEPERMS for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1) is modified by the REVOKE statement. The dependency manager sends a revoke invalidation message to the view user2.v1, and the view is dropped, even though the view is not dependent on the DELETE privilege for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1).\n\nColumn-level privileges:\n\nOnly one type of privilege for a specified grantee and table ID are stored in one row in the SYSCOLPERMS system table. For example, when user2 is granted the SELECT privilege on table user1.t1 for columns c12 and c13, a row is added to the SYSCOLPERMS. The GRANTEE field contains user2, the TABLEID contains user1.t1, the TYPE field contains S, and the COLUMNS field contains c12, c13.\n\nWhen a grantee creates an object that relies on the privilege type and the subset of columns in a table ID, the Derby engine tracks the dependency of the object on the specific row in the SYSCOLPERMS table. For example, user2 creates the view v1 by using the statement SELECT c11 FROM user1.t1; the dependency manager tracks the dependency of view v1 on the row in SYSCOLPERMS for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1), TYPE(S). The dependency manager knows that the view is dependent on the SELECT privilege type but does not track exactly which columns the view is dependent on.\n\nWhen a REVOKE statement for a column-level privilege is issued for a grantee, table ID, and type, all of the objects that are dependent on the grantee, table ID, and type are dropped. For example, if user1 revokes the SELECT privilege on column c12 on table user1.t1 from user2, the row in SYSCOLPERMS for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1), TYPE(S) is modified by the REVOKE statement. The dependency manager sends a revoke invalidation message to the view user2.v1, and the view is dropped, even though the view is not dependent on the column c12 for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1), TYPE(S).\n\nIf Unified Auditing is used:\n\nApply the same process used in standard auditing to the tables with AUDSYS as the owner.",

The dependency manager sends a revoke invalidation message to the view user2.v1, and the view is dropped, even though the view is not dependent on the column c12 for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1), TYPE(S).\n\nIf Unified Auditing is used:\n\nApply the same process used in standard auditing to the tables with AUDSYS as the owner.",

An Oracle wallet is a secure software container that stores authentication and signing credentials.\n\nThis wallet usage can simplify large-scale deployments that rely on password credentials for connecting to databases. When this feature is configured, application code, batch jobs, and scripts no longer need embedded user names and passwords. This reduces risk because the passwords are no longer exposed, and password management policies are more easily enforced without changing application code whenever user names or passwords change.\n\nThe external password store of the wallet is separate from the area where public key infrastructure (PKI) credentials are stored. Consequently, Oracle Wallet Manager cannot be used to manage credentials in the external password store of the wallet. Instead, use the command-line utility mkstore to manage these credentials.\n\nHow Does the External Password Store Work?\n\nTypically, users (and applications, batch jobs, and scripts) connect to databases by using a standard CONNECT statement that specifies a database connection string. This string can include a user name and password, and an Oracle Net service name identifying the database on an Oracle Database network. If the password is omitted, the connection prompts the user for the password.\n\nFor example, the service name could be the URL that identifies that database, or a TNS alias entered in the tnsnames.ora file in the database. Another possibility is a host:port:sid string.\n\nThe following examples are standard CONNECT statements that could be used for a client that is not configured to use the external password store:\n\n  CONNECT salesapp@sales_db.us.example.com\n  Enter password: password\n\n  CONNECT salesapp@orasales\n  Enter password: password\n\n  CONNECT salesapp@ourhost37:1527:DB17\n  Enter password: password\n\nIn these examples, salesapp is the user name, with the unique connection string for the database shown as specified in three different ways; use its URL sales_db.us.example.com, or its TNS alias, orasales, from the tnsnames.ora file, or its host:port:sid string.\n\nHowever, when clients are configured to use the secure external password store, applications can connect to a database with the following CONNECT statement syntax, without specifying database logon credentials:\n\n  CONNECT /@db_connect_string\n\n  CONNECT /@db_connect_string AS SYSDBA\n\n  CONNECT /@db_connect_string AS SYSOPER\n\nIn this specification, db_connect_string is a valid connection string to access the intended database, such as the service name, URL, or alias as shown in the earlier examples. Each user account must have its own unique connection string; cannot create one connection string for multiple users.\n\nIn this case, the database credentials, user name and password, are securely stored in an Oracle wallet created for this purpose. The autologon feature of this wallet is turned on, so the system does not need a password to open the wallet. From the wallet, it gets the credentials to access the database for the user they represent.",
            "FixText": "Develop, document, and maintain a list of DBMS database objects, database configuration files, associated scripts, and applications defined within, or external to, the DBMS that access the database, and DBMS/user environment files/settings in the System Security Plan.\n\nRecord whether they do or do not contain DBMS passwords. If passwords are present, ensure they are encoded or encrypted and protected by host system security.\n\n- - - - -\nThe following are notes on implementing a Secure External Password Store using Oracle Wallet.\n\nOracle provides the capability to provide for a secure external password facility. Use the Oracle mkstore to create a secure storage area for passwords for applications, batch jobs, and scripts to use, or deploy a site-authorized facility to perform this function.\n\nCheck to see what has been stored in the Oracle External Password Store.\n\nTo view all contents of a client wallet external password store, check specific credentials by viewing them. Listing the external password store contents provides information that can be used to decide whether to add or delete credentials from the store. To list the contents of the external password store, enter the following command at the command line:\n\n$ mkstore -wrl wallet_location -listCredential\n\nFor example: $ mkstore -wrl c:\\oracle\\product\\12.1.0\\db_1\\wallets -listCredential\n\nThe wallet_location specifies the path to the directory where the wallet, whose external password store contents is to be viewed, is located. This command lists all of the credential database service names (aliases) and the corresponding user name (schema) for that database. Passwords are not listed.\n\nConfiguring Clients to Use the External Password Store:\n\nIf the client is already configured to use external authentication, such as Windows built-in authentication or Transport Layer Security (TLS), then Oracle Database uses that authentication method. The same credentials used for this type of authentication are typically also used to log on to the database.\n\nFor clients not using such authentication methods or wanting to override them for database authentication, can set the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameter in sqlnet.ora to TRUE. The default value for SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE is FALSE, allowing standard use of authentication credentials as before.\n\nIf wanting a client to use the secure external password store feature, then perform the following configuration task:\n\n1. Create a wallet on the client by using the following syntax at the command line:\n\nmkstore -wrl wallet_location -create\n\nFor example: mkstore -wrl c:\\oracle\\product\\12.1.0\\db_1\\wallets -create\nEnter password: password\n\nThe wallet_location is the path to the directory where the wallet is to be created and stored. This command creates an Oracle wallet with the autologon feature enabled at the location specified. The autologon feature enables the client to access the wallet contents without supplying a password.\n\nThe mkstore utility -create option uses password complexity verification.\n\n2. Create database connection credentials in the wallet by using the following syntax at the command line:\n\nmkstore -wrl wallet_location -createCredential db_connect_string username\nEnter password: password\n\nFor example: mkstore -wrl c:\\oracle\\product\\12.1.0\\db_1\\wallets -createCredential oracle system\nEnter password: password\n\nIn this specification, the wallet_location is the path to the directory where the wallet was created. The db_connect_string used in the CONNECT /@db_connect_string statement must be identical to the db_connect_string specified in the -createCredential command. The db_connect_string is the TNS alias used to specify the database in the tnsnames.ora file or any service name used to identify the database on an Oracle network. By default, tnsnames.ora is located in the $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin directory on UNIX systems and in ORACLE_HOME\\network\\admin on Windows. The username is the database logon credential. When prompted, enter the password for this user.\n\n3. In the client sqlnet.ora file, enter the WALLET_LOCATION parameter and set it to the directory location of the wallet created in Step 1. For example, if the wallet was created in $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin and Oracle home is set to /private/ora12, then enter the following into client sqlnet.ora file:\n\n    WALLET_LOCATION =\n           (SOURCE =\n             (METHOD = FILE)\n             (METHOD_DATA =\n           (DIRECTORY = /private/ora12/network/admin)\n           )\n          )\n\n4. In the client sqlnet.ora file, enter the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameter and set it to TRUE as follows:\n\nSQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE = TRUE\n\nThis setting causes all CONNECT /@db_connect_string statements to use the information in the wallet at the specified location to authenticate to databases.\n\nWhen external authentication is in use, an authenticated user with such a wallet can use the CONNECT /@db_connect_string syntax to access the previously specified databases without providing a user name and password. However, if a user fails that external authentication, then these connect statements also fail.\n\nBelow is a sample sqlnet.ora file with the WALLET_LOCATION and the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameters set as described in Steps 3 and 4.\n\n        WALLET_LOCATION =\n            (SOURCE =\n              (METHOD = FILE)\n              (METHOD_DATA =\n            (DIRECTORY = /private/ora12/network/admin)\n              )\n             )\n        SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE = TRUE\n        SSL_CLIENT_AUTHENTICATION = FALSE\n        SSL_VERSION = 1.2\n\n(Note: This assumes that a single sqlnet.ora file, in the default location, is in use. Please see the supplemental file \"Non-default sqlnet.ora configurations.pdf\" for how to find multiple and/or differently located sqlnet.ora files.)",

            "FixText": "Configure DBMS settings to terminate sessions upon user logoff.  Configure DBMS settings to terminate sessions upon the occurrence of any organization or policy-defined session termination event.\n\n- - - - -\n\nTo configure specific session termination processes, we need to define the organization or policy-defined session termination event. Below are some examples.\n\nOracle has several ways to disconnect idle sessions, both from within SQL*Plus via resources profiles (connect_time, idle_time) and with the SQL*net expire time parameter.\n\nCan use profiles to set the connect time and idle time with \"alter profile\" statements:\n\nalter profile senior_claim_analyst limit\nconnect_time 15\nsessions_per_user 2\nldle_time 10;\n\nProfiles comprise a named set of resource limits. By default, when users are created, they are given the default profile, which provides unlimited use of all resources.\n\nThe syntax to create a profile follows:\n\nCREATE PROFILE LIMIT resource_parameters|password_parameters;\nResource_parameters:\n[SESSIONS_PER_USER n|UNLIMITED|DEFAULT]\n[CPU_PER_SESSION n|UNLIMITED|DEFAULT]\n[CPU_PER_CALL n|UNLIMITED|DEFAULT]\n[CONNECT_TIME n|UNLIMITED|DEFAULT]\n[IDLE_TIME n|UNLIMITED|DEFAULT]\n\nBy setting resource limits, can prevent users from performing operations that will tie up the system and prevent other users from performing operations. Can use resource limits for security, to ensure that users log off the system, so as not to leave the session connected for long periods of time.\n\nThe system resource limits can be enforced at the session level, the call level, or both. The session level is calculated from the time the user logs on to the database until the user exits. The call level applies to each SQL command issued. Session-level limits are enforced for each connection. When a session-level limit is exceeded, only the last SQL command issued is rolled back; no further work can be performed until a commit, rollback, or exit is performed.\n\nUsing SQLNET.EXPIRE_TIME\n\nThe sqlnet.expire_time parameter is used to set a time interval, in minutes, to determine how often a probe should be sent verifying that client/server connections are active. If there is a need to ensure that connections are not left open indefinitely (or up to the time set by operating system-specific parameters), set a value that is greater than 0. This protects the system from connections left open due to an abnormal client termination.\n\nWhen the probe detects a terminated connection or a connection no longer in use, it signals an error, causing the server process to exit. This setting is intended for use on the database server side of the connection, which usually handles multiple connections at any one time. Limitations on using this terminated (dead) connection detection feature are:\n\nsqlnet.expire_time cannot be used on bequeathed connections.\n\nThe SQL*Net expire_time probe packet will generate additional network traffic that may downgrade the network's performance, depending on the number of connections.\n\nDepending on the operating system that is in use, additional server processing may need to be performed to distinguish the connection probe from other events that occur. This overhead for detection of probe events can result in downgraded network performance.\n\nTurning-on expire_time\n\nTo set up these advanced features, simply edit the sqlnet.ora file. If a beginner, follow this procedure:\n\nStart the Oracle Network Manager GUI.\n\nIn the GUI navigator pane, expand the icons Local >> Profile.\n\nFrom the list on the right-hand pane, select General.\n\nClick on the Advanced tab.\n\nNext, enter the values for the fields or options to set.\n\nWhen finished, choose File >> Save Network Configuration to write the changes to the sqlnet.ora file. (Note: This assumes that a single sqlnet.ora file, in the default location, is in use. Please see the supplemental file \"Non-default sqlnet.ora configurations.pdf\" for how to find multiple and/or differently located sqlnet.ora files.)\n\nThe sqlnet.ora inbound_connect_timeout parameter\n\nThe sqlnet.ora inbound_connect_timeout parameter is used to limit the time, set in seconds, for a client to connect with the database server and provide the required authentication information.\n\nAlso see sqlnet.inbound_connect_timeout tips.\n\nTo limit consumption of Oracle resources by unauthorized users and enable an audit trail, should set time-limit values for the sqlnet.inbound_connect_timeout parameter in wall-clock seconds. (This parameter does not have default values.) Failure resulting from sqlnet.inbound_connect_timeout will throw an ORA-03136 inbound connection timed out error.",

If a constraint is enabled, data is checked as it is entered or updated in the database, and data that does not conform to the constraint is prevented from being entered. If a constraint is disabled, then data that does not conform can be allowed to enter the database.\n\nAdditionally, can specify that existing data in the table must conform to the constraint (VALIDATE). Conversely, if specified NOVALIDATE, are not ensured that existing data conforms.\n\nAn integrity constraint defined on a table can be in one of the following states:\n    ENABLE, VALIDATE\n    ENABLE, NOVALIDATE\n    DISABLE, VALIDATE\n    DISABLE, NOVALIDATE\n\nFor details about the meaning of these states and an understanding of their consequences, see the Oracle Database SQL Language Reference. Some of these consequences are discussed here.\n\nDisabling Constraints\nTo enforce the rules defined by integrity constraints, the constraints should always be enabled. However, consider temporarily disabling the integrity constraints of a table for the following performance reasons:\n\n- When loading large amounts of data into a table\n\n- When performing batch operations that make massive changes to a table (for example, changing every employee's number by adding 1000 to the existing number)\n\n- When importing or exporting one table at a time\n\nIn all three cases, temporarily disabling integrity constraints can improve the performance of the operation, especially in data warehouse configurations.\n\nIt is possible to enter data that violates a constraint while that constraint is disabled. Thus, always enable the constraint after completing any of the operations listed in the preceding bullet list.\n\nEnabling Constraints\nWhile a constraint is enabled, no row violating the constraint can be inserted into the table. However, while the constraint is disabled, such a row can be inserted. This row is known as an exception to the constraint. If the constraint is in the ENABLE, NOVALIDATE state, violations resulting from data entered while the constraint was disabled remain. The rows that violate the constraint must be either updated or deleted in order for the constraint to be put in the validated state.\n\nCan identify exceptions to a specific integrity constraint while attempting to enable the constraint. See \"Reporting Constraint Exceptions\". All rows violating constraints are noted in an EXCEPTIONS table, which can be examined.\n\nENABLE, NOVALIDATE Constraint State\nWhen a constraint is in the ENABLE, NOVALIDATE state, all subsequent statements are checked for conformity to the constraint. However, any existing data in the table is not checked. A table with ENABLE, NOVALIDATE constraints can contain invalid data, but it is not possible to add new invalid data to it. Constraints in the ENABLE, NOVALIDATE state is most useful in data warehouse configurations that are uploading valid OLTP data.\n\nEnabling a constraint does not require validation. Enabling a constraint novalidate is much faster than enabling and validating a constraint. Also, validating a constraint that is already enabled does not require any DML locks during validation (unlike validating a previously disabled constraint). Enforcement guarantees that no violations are introduced during the validation. Hence, enabling without validating reduces the downtime typically associated with enabling a constraint.\n\nEfficient Use of Integrity Constraints: A Procedure\n\nUsing integrity constraint states in the following order can ensure the best benefits:\n    Disable state.\n    Perform the operation (load, export, import).\n    ENABLE, NOVALIDATE state.\n    Enable state.\n\nSome benefits of using constraints in this order are:\n    No locks are held.\n    All constraints can go to enable state concurrently.\n    Constraint enabling is done in parallel.\n    Concurrent activity on table is permitted.\n\nSetting Integrity Constraints Upon Definition\nWhen an integrity constraint is defined in a CREATE TABLE or ALTER TABLE statement, it can be enabled, disabled, or validated or not validated as determined by the specification of the ENABLE/DISABLE clause. If the ENABLE/DISABLE clause is not specified in a constraint definition, the database automatically enables and validates the constraint.\n\nDisabling Constraints Upon Definition\nThe following CREATE TABLE and ALTER TABLE statements both define and disable integrity constraints:\n\nCREATE TABLE emp (\n   empno NUMBER(5) PRIMARY KEY DISABLE,   . . . ;\n\nALTER TABLE emp\n   ADD PRIMARY KEY (empno) DISABLE;\n\nAn ALTER TABLE statement that defines and disables an integrity constraint never fails because of rows in the table that violate the integrity constraint. The definition of the constraint is allowed because its rule is not enforced.\n\nEnabling Constraints Upon Definition\n\nThe following CREATE TABLE and ALTER TABLE statements both define and enable integrity constraints:\n\nCREATE TABLE emp (\n    empno NUMBER(5) CONSTRAINT emp.pk PRIMARY KEY,   . . . ;\n\nALTER TABLE emp\n    ADD CONSTRAINT emp.pk PRIMARY KEY (empno);\n\nAn ALTER TABLE statement that defines and attempts to enable an integrity constraint can fail because rows of the table violate the integrity constraint.

Therefore, the use of plain-text passwords must be prohibited, as a matter of practice and procedure.\n\nTransport Layer Security (TLS) is the successor protocol to Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). Although the Oracle configuration parameters have names including 'SSL', such as SSL_VERSION and SSL_CIPHER_SUITES, they refer to TLS.",

            "FixText": "\"For Oracle SQL*Plus, which cannot be configured not to accept a plain-text password, and any other essential tool with the same limitation:\n\n1) Document the need for it, who uses it, and any relevant mitigations, and obtain AO approval.\n2) Train all users of the tool in the importance of not using the plain-text password option and in how to keep the password hidden.\n\n- - - - -\nConsider wrapping the startup command with a shell or wrapper and using an Oracle external password store.\n\nOracle provides the capability to provide for a secure external password facility.  Use the Oracle mkstore to create a secure storage area for passwords for applications, batch jobs, and scripts to use or deploy a site-authorized facility to perform this function.\n\nCheck to see what has been stored in the Oracle External Password Store.\n\nTo view all contents of a client wallet external password store, check specific credentials by viewing them. Listing the external password store contents provides information used to decide whether to add or delete credentials from the store.  To list the contents of the external password store, enter the following command at the command line:\n\n  $ mkstore -wrl wallet_location -listCredential\n\n  For example:\n\n  $ mkstore -wrl c:\\oracle\\product\\12.1.0\\db_1\\wallets -listCredential\n\nThe wallet_location specifies the path to the directory where the wallet, whose external password store contents is to be viewed, is located. This command lists all of the credential database service names (aliases) and the corresponding user name (schema) for that database. Passwords are not listed.\n\nConfiguring Clients to Use the External Password Store\n\nIf the client is already configured to use external authentication, such as Windows native authentication or Transport Layer Security (TLS), then Oracle Database uses that authentication method. The same credentials used for this type of authentication are typically also used to log on to the database.\n\nFor clients not using such authentication methods or wanting to override them for database authentication, set the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameter in sqlnet.ora to TRUE. The default value for SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE is FALSE, allowing standard use of authentication credentials as before.\n\nIf wanting a client to use the secure external password store feature, then perform the following configuration task:\n\n1. Create a wallet on the client by using the following syntax at the command line:\norapki create -wallet wallet_location  -auto_login_local\n\nFor example:\norapki wallet create -wallet c:\\oracle\\product\\12.1.0\\db_1\\wallets -auto_login_local\nEnter password: password\n\nThe wallet_location is the path to the directory where the wallet is to be created and stored. This command creates an Oracle wallet with the autologon feature enabled at the location specified. The autologon feature enables the client to access the wallet contents without supplying a password.\n\nThe mkstore utility -create option uses password complexity verification.\n\n2. Create database connection credentials in the wallet by using the following syntax at the command line:\nmkstore -wrl wallet_location -createCredential db_connect_string username\nEnter password: password\n\nFor example:\nmkstore -wrl c:\\oracle\\product\\12.1.0\\db_1\\wallets -createCredential oracle system\nEnter password: password\n\nIn this specification:\nThe wallet_location is the path to the directory where the wallet was created.  The db_connect_string used in the CONNECT /@db_connect_string statement must be identical to the db_connect_string specified in the -createCredential command.\n\nThe db_connect_string is the TNS alias used to specify the database in the tnsnames.ora file or any service name used to identify the database on an Oracle network. By default, tnsnames.ora is located in the $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin directory on UNIX systems and in ORACLE_HOME\\network\\admin on Windows.\n\nThe username is the database logon credential. When prompted, enter the password for this user.\n\n3. In the client sqlnet.ora file, enter the WALLET_LOCATION parameter and set it to the directory location of the wallet created in Step 1.  For example, if the wallet was created in $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin and the Oracle home is set to /private/ora12, then need to enter the following into the client sqlnet.ora file:\n\n    WALLET_LOCATION =\n           (SOURCE =\n             (METHOD = FILE)\n             (METHOD_DATA =\n           (DIRECTORY = /private/ora12/network/admin)\n           )\n          )\n\n4. In the client sqlnet.ora file, enter the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameter and set it to TRUE as follows:\n\n       SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE = TRUE\n\nThis setting causes all CONNECT /@db_connect_string statements to use the information in the wallet at the specified location to authenticate to databases.\n\nWhen external authentication is in use, an authenticated user with such a wallet can use the CONNECT /@db_connect_string syntax to access the previously specified databases without providing a user name and password. However, if a user fails that external authentication, then these connect statements also fail.\n\nBelow is a sample sqlnet.ora file with the WALLET_LOCATION and the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameters set as described in Steps 3 and 4.\n\nBelow is a sample SQLNET.ORA File with Wallet Parameters Set\n\n        WALLET_LOCATION =\n            (SOURCE =\n              (METHOD = FILE)\n              (METHOD_DATA =\n            (DIRECTORY = /private/ora12/network/admin)\n              )\n             )\n\n        SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE = TRUE\n        SSL_CLIENT_AUTHENTICATION = FALSE\n        SSL_VERSION =1.2\n\n(Note: This assumes that a single sqlnet.ora file, in the default location, is in use. Please see the supplemental file \"Non-default sqlnet.ora configurations.pdf\" for how to find multiple and/or differently located sqlnet.ora files.)",

If the default setting of UNLIMITED in the DEFAULT profile has not changed, then the database treats the value for that parameter as UNLIMITED.\n\nIf setting both of these parameters to UNLIMITED, then the database ignores both of them. This is the default if omitting both parameters.\n\nPASSWORD_LOCK_TIME - Specify the number of days an account will be locked after the specified number of consecutive failed logon attempts. If omitting this clause, then the default is 1 day.\n\nPASSWORD_GRACE_TIME - Specify the number of days after the grace period begins during which a warning is issued and logon is allowed. If omitting this clause, then the default is 7 days.\n\nPASSWORD_VERIFY_FUNCTION - The PASSWORD_VERIFY_FUNCTION clause lets a PL/SQL password complexity verification script be passed as an argument to the CREATE PROFILE statement. Oracle Database provides a default script, but can create your own routine or use third-party software instead.",

Evidence of implementation includes records of backup events and physical review of backup media.\n\nEvidence should match the backup plan as recorded in the system documentation.\n\nIf backup procedures do not exist or are not implemented in accordance with the procedures, this is a finding.\n\n- - - - -\nThe Oracle recommended process for backup and recovery is Oracle RMAN. If Oracle RMAN is deployed, execute the following commands to ensure that the evidence of the implementation of the backup policy includes validating that the files are restorable:\n\nValidating Database Files with BACKUP VALIDATE\n--Use the BACKUP VALIDATE command to do the following:\n--Check datafiles for physical and logical block corruption\n--Confirm that all database files exist and are in the correct locations\n--When BACKUP VALIDATE is run, RMAN reads the files to be backed up in their entirety, as it would during a real backup. RMAN does not, however, actually produce any backup sets or image copies.\n--Cannot use the BACKUPSET, MAXCORRUPT, or PROXY parameters with BACKUP VALIDATE.\n--To validate files with the BACKUP VALIDATE command:\n  1. Start RMAN and connect to a target database and recovery catalog (if used).\n  2. Run the BACKUP VALIDATE command.\n\nFor example, can validate that all database files and archived logs can be backed up by running a command as shown in the following example. This command checks for physical corruptions only.\n\nBACKUP VALIDATE\nDATABASE\nARCHIVELOG ALL;\n\nTo check for logical corruptions in addition to physical corruptions, run the  following variation of the preceding command:\n\nBACKUP VALIDATE\nCHECK LOGICAL\nDATABASE\nARCHIVELOG ALL;\n\nIn the preceding examples, the RMAN client displays the same output that it would if it were really backing up the files. If RMAN cannot back up one or more of the files, then it issues an error message.\n\nValidating Backups Before Restoring Them\n\nRun RESTORE ... VALIDATE to test whether RMAN can restore a specific file or set of files from a backup. RMAN chooses which backups to use. The database must be mounted or open for this command. Do not have to take datafiles off-line when validating the restore of datafiles, because validation of backups of the datafiles only reads the backups and does not affect the production datafiles. When validating files on disk or tape, RMAN reads all blocks in the backup piece or image copy. RMAN also validates off-site backups. The validation is identical to a real restore operation except that RMAN does not write output files.\n\nTo validate backups with the RESTORE command:\n1. Run the RESTORE command with the VALIDATE option.\n\nThis following example illustrates validating the restore of the database and all archived redo logs:\n\nRESTORE DATABASE VALIDATE;\nRESTORE ARCHIVELOG ALL VALIDATE;\n\nIf an RMAN error stack is not generated, then skip the subsequent steps. The lack of error messages means that RMAN had confirmed that it can use these backups successfully during a real restore and recovery.\n\n2. If error messages are seen in the output and one is the RMAN-06026 message, then investigate the cause of the problem. If possible, correct the problem that is preventing RMAN from validating the backups and retry the validation. The following error means that RMAN cannot restore one or more of the specified files from available backups:\n\nRMAN-06026: some targets not found - aborting restore\nThe following sample output shows that RMAN encountered a problem reading the specified backup:\n\nRMAN-03009: failure of restore command on c1 channel at 12-DEC-14 23:22:30\nORA-19505: failed to identify file \"oracle/dbs/1fafv9gl_1_1\"\nORA-27037: unable to obtain file status\nSVR4 Error: 2: No such file or directory\nAdditional information: 3",

In a default Oracle installation, all passwords are stored in an encrypted manner.  Ask the DBA if they have created an External Password Store for applications, batch jobs, and scripts to use.\n\nSecure External Password Store\n\nCan store password credentials for connecting to databases by using a client-side Oracle wallet. An Oracle wallet is a secure software container that stores authentication and signing credentials.\n\nThis wallet usage can simplify large-scale deployments that rely on password credentials for connecting to databases. When this feature is configured, application code, batch jobs, and scripts no longer need embedded user names and passwords. This reduces risk because the passwords are no longer exposed, and password management policies are more easily enforced without changing application code whenever user names or passwords change.\n\nThe external password store of the wallet is separate from the area where public key infrastructure (PKI) credentials are stored. Consequently, cannot use Oracle Wallet Manager to manage credentials in the external password store of the wallet. Instead, use the command-line utility mkstore to manage these credentials.\n\nHow Does the External Password Store Work?\n\nTypically, users (and as applications, batch jobs, and scripts) connect to databases by using a standard CONNECT statement that specifies a database connection string. This string can include a user name and password, and an Oracle Net service name identifying the database on an Oracle Database network. If the password is omitted, the connection prompts the user for the password.\n\nFor example, the service name could be the URL that identifies that database, or a TNS alias entered in the tnsnames.ora file in the database. Another possibility is a host:port:sid string.\n\nThe following examples are standard CONNECT statements that could be used for a client that is not configured to use the external password store:\n\n  CONNECT salesapp@sales_db.us.example.com\n  Enter password: password\n\n  CONNECT salesapp@orasales\n  Enter password: password\n\n  CONNECT salesapp@ourhost37:1527:DB17\n  Enter password: password\n\nIn these examples, salesapp is the user name, with the unique connection string for the database shown as specified in three different ways. Could use its URL sales_db.us.example.com, or its TNS alias, orasales, from the tnsnames.ora file, or its host:port:sid string.\n\nHowever, when clients are configured to use the secure external password store, applications can connect to a database with the following CONNECT statement syntax, without specifying database logon credentials:\n\n  CONNECT /@db_connect_string\n\n  CONNECT /@db_connect_string AS SYSDBA\n\n  CONNECT /@db_connect_string AS SYSOPER\n  \nIn this specification, db_connect_string is a valid connection string to access the intended database, such as the service name, URL, or alias as shown in the earlier examples. Each user account must have its own unique connection string; cannot create one connection string for multiple users.\n\nIn this case, the database credentials, user name and password, are securely stored in an Oracle wallet created for this purpose. The autologon feature of this wallet is turned on, so the system does not need a password to open the wallet. From the wallet, it gets the credentials to access the database for the user they represent.",
            "FixText": "Design DBMS application code and batch job code that is compiled, encoded or encrypted, to NOT contain passwords.\n\n- - - - -\nOracle provides the capability to provide for a secure external password facility.  Use the Oracle mkstore to create a secure storage area for passwords for applications, batch jobs, and scripts to use or deploy a site-authorized facility to perform this function.\n\nCheck to see what has been stored in the Oracle External Password Store\n\nTo view all contents of a client wallet external password store, check specific credentials by viewing them. Listing the external password store contents provides information can use to decide whether to add or delete credentials from the store.  To list the contents of the external password store, enter the following command at the command line:\n\n  $ mkstore -wrl wallet_location -listCredential\n\n  For example:\n\n  $ mkstore -wrl c:\\oracle\\product\\12.1.0\\db_1\\wallets -listCredential\n\nThe wallet_location specifies the path to the directory where the wallet, whose external password store contents is to be viewed, is located. This command lists all of the credential database service names (aliases) and the corresponding user name (schema) for that database. Passwords are not listed.\n\nConfiguring Clients to Use the External Password Store\n\nIf the client is already configured to use external authentication, such as Windows native authentication or Transport Layer Security (TLS), then Oracle Database uses that authentication method. The same credentials used for this type of authentication are typically also used to log on to the database.\n\nFor clients not using such authentication methods or wanting to override them for database authentication, can set the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameter in sqlnet.ora to TRUE. The default value for SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE is FALSE, allowing standard use of authentication credentials as before.\n\nIf wanting a client to use the secure external password store feature, then perform the following configuration task:\n\n 1. Create a wallet on the client by using the following syntax at the command line:\n\n mkstore -wrl wallet_location -create\n\n    For example:\n\n    mkstore -wrl c:\\oracle\\product\\12.1.0\\db_1\\wallets -create\n    Enter password: password\n\nThe wallet_location is the path to the directory where the wallet is to be created and stored. This command creates an Oracle wallet with the autologon feature enabled at the location specified. The autologon feature enables the client to access the wallet contents without supplying a password. \n\nThe mkstore utility -create option uses password complexity verification.\n\n 2. Create database connection credentials in the wallet by using the following syntax at the command line:\n\n    mkstore -wrl wallet_location -createCredential db_connect_string username\n    Enter password: password\n\n    For example:\n\n    mkstore -wrl c:\\oracle\\product\\12.1.0\\db_1\\wallets -createCredential oracle system\n    Enter password: password\n\n    In this specification:\n\nThe wallet_location is the path to the directory where the wallet was created.  The db_connect_string used in the CONNECT /@db_connect_string statement must be identical to the db_connect_string specified in the -createCredential command.\n\nThe db_connect_string is the TNS alias used to specify the database in the tnsnames.ora file or any service name used to identify the database on an Oracle network. By default, tnsnames.ora is located in the $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin directory on UNIX systems and in ORACLE_HOME\\network\\admin on Windows.\n\nThe username is the database logon credential. When prompted, enter the password for this user.\n\n 3. In the client sqlnet.ora file, enter the WALLET_LOCATION parameter and set it to the directory location of the wallet created in Step 1.  For example, if the wallet was created in\n       $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin and Oracle home is set to /private/ora12, then need to enter the following into your client sqlnet.ora file:\n\n    WALLET_LOCATION =\n           (SOURCE =\n             (METHOD = FILE)\n             (METHOD_DATA =\n           (DIRECTORY = /private/ora12/network/admin)\n           )\n          )\n\n 4. In the client sqlnet.ora file, enter the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameter and set it to TRUE as follows:\n\n       SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE = TRUE\n\nsetting causes all CONNECT /@db_connect_string statements to use the information in the wallet at the specified location to authenticate to databases.\n\nWhen external authentication is in use, an authenticated user with such a wallet can use the CONNECT /@db_connect_string syntax to access the previously specified databases without providing a user name and password. However, if a user fails that external authentication, then these connect statements also fail.\n\nBelow is a sample sqlnet.ora file with the WALLET_LOCATION and the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameters set as described in Steps 3 and 4.\n\nBelow is a sample SQLNET.ORA File with Wallet Parameters Set\n\n        WALLET_LOCATION =\n            (SOURCE =\n              (METHOD = FILE)\n              (METHOD_DATA =\n            (DIRECTORY = /private/ora12/network/admin)\n              )\n             )\n\n        SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE = TRUE\n        SSL_CLIENT_AUTHENTICATION = FALSE\n        SSL_VERSION = 1.2\n\n(Note:  this assumes that a single sqlnet.ora file, in the default location, is in use.  Please see the supplemental file, \"Non-default sqlnet.ora configurations.pdf\" for how to find multiple and/or differently-located sqlnet.ora files.)",
