Unlimited concurrent connections to the DBMS could allow a successful Denial of Service (DoS) attack by exhausting connection resources and a system can also fail or be degraded by an overload of legitimate users. Limiting the number of concurrent sessions per user is helpful in reducing these risks.\n\nThis requirement addresses concurrent session control for a single account. It does not address concurrent sessions by a single user via multiple system accounts and it does not deal with the total number of sessions across all accounts.\n\nThe capability to limit the number of concurrent sessions per user must be configured in or added to the DBMS (for example, by use of a logon trigger), when this is technically feasible. Note that it is not sufficient to limit sessions via a web server or application server alone, because legitimate users and adversaries can potentially connect to the DBMS by other means.\n\nThe organization will need to define the maximum number of concurrent sessions by account type, by account, or a combination thereof. In deciding on the appropriate number, it is important to consider the work requirements of the various types of users. For example, 2 might be an acceptable limit for general users accessing the database via an application; but 10 might be too few for a database administrator using a database management GUI tool, where each query tab and navigation pane may count as a separate session.\n\n(Sessions may also be referred to as connections or logons, which for the purposes of this requirement are synonyms.)\n\nLimiting Concurrent Requests with User Session Limits\nThere is an option on each App Server (HTTP, ODBC, XDBC, and WebDAV Server) configuration to limit the number of concurrent requests a user can have against that App Server. A concurrent request is defined to be a request against that App Server from the same user while another request from the same user is still active. Each App Server has a concurrent request limit configuration parameter. The default is 0, which means there is no limit to the number of concurrent requests. The value must be an integer greater than or equal to 0.\n\nSetting the concurrent request limit configuration parameter to a value other than 0 limits the number of concurrent requests any user can run against that App Server to the specified number. For example, by setting the number to 3, any requests made by a user named Raymond while 3 requests from Raymond are running will fail with an exception.\n\nWhen the limit is reached, the application will throw a 403 (forbidden) error with the XDMP-REQUESTLIMIT exception.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>", "VulnDiscussion": "Database management includes the ability to control the number of users and user sessions utilizing a DBMS.

Application-level authentication is available on HTTP, ODBC, and WebDAV servers.\n- In Kerberos Ticket, the user is authenticated by Kerberos and a Kerberos session ticket is used to authenticate the user to access MarkLogic Server.\n- When SAML authentication is used, a client requests a resource from MarkLogic Server with no security context.

Increasing security risks and compliance requirements sometimes mandate the use of encryption at rest to prevent unauthorized access to data on disk.\n\nEncryption at rest can be configured to encrypt data, log files, and configuration files separately. Encryption is only applied to newly created files once encryption at rest is enabled, and does not apply to existing files without further action by the user. For existing data, a merge or re-index will trigger encryption of data, a configuration change will trigger encryption of configuration files, and log rotation will initiate log encryption.\n\nFor more information:\nSee: https://docs.marklogic.com/guide/security/encryption", "FalsePositives": "", "FalseNegatives": "", "Documentable": "false", "Mitigations": "", "SeverityOverrideGuidance": "", "PotentialImpacts": "", "ThirdPartyTools": "", "MitigationControl": "", "Responsibility": "", "IAControls": "", "CheckText": "If the application owner and Authorizing Official have determined that encryption of data at rest is NOT required, this is not a finding.\n\nIf full-disk encryption is being used, this is not a finding.\n\nReview system documentation to determine whether the system handles classified information.

For example, many browsers today provide the capability to install their own patch software. Patch criticality, as well as system criticality, will vary.

Flaws discovered during security assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response activities, or information system error handling must also be addressed expeditiously. \n\nOrganization-defined time periods for updating security-relevant software may vary based on a variety of factors including, for example, the security category of the information system or the criticality of the update (i.e., severity of the vulnerability related to the discovered flaw). \n\nThis requirement will apply to software patch management solutions used to install patches across the enclave and also to applications themselves not part of that patch management solution.
