Hence, its rekey or key regeneration procedure is very important. The Phase 2 rekey can be performed with or without Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS).

The new DH shared secret will be included with original keying material (SYKEID_d, initiator nonce, and responder nonce from Phase 1 for generating a new IPsec session key.
