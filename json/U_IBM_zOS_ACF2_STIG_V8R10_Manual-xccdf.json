For non-kernel code, security function isolation is often achieved through file system protections that serve to protect the code on disk and address space protections that protect executing code.\n\nDevelopers and implementers can increase the assurance in security functions by employing well-defined security policy models; structured, disciplined, and rigorous hardware and software development techniques; and sound system/security engineering principles. Implementation may include isolation of memory space and libraries. Operating systems restrict access to security functions through the use of access control mechanisms and by implementing least privilege capabilities.\n\nPreventing non-privileged users from executing privileged functions mitigates the risk that unauthorized individuals or processes may gain unnecessary access to information or privileges.\n\nPrivileged functions include, for example, establishing accounts, performing system integrity checks, or administering cryptographic key management activities. Non-privileged users are individuals that do not possess appropriate authorizations. Circumventing intrusion detection and prevention mechanisms or malicious code protection mechanisms are examples of privileged functions that require protection from non-privileged users.\n\nSatisfies: SRG-OS-000134-GPOS-00068, SRG-OS-000080-GPOS-00048, SRG-OS-000259-GPOS-00100, SRG-OS-000324-GPOS-00125", "FalsePositives": "", "FalseNegatives": "", "Documentable": "false", "Mitigations": "", "SeverityOverrideGuidance": "", "PotentialImpacts": "", "ThirdPartyTools": "", "MitigationControl": "", "Responsibility": "", "IAControls": "", "CheckText": "Determine all associated ESM security data sets and/or databases.\n\nIf the ESM data set rules for ESM security data sets and/or databases restrict READ access to auditors and DASD batch, this is not a finding.\n\nIf the ESM data set rules for ESM security data sets and/or databases restrict READ and/or greater access to z/OS systems programming personnel, security personnel, and/or batch jobs that perform ACP maintenance, this is not a finding.\n\nIf all (i.e., failures and successes) data set access authorities (i.e., READ, UPDATE, ALTER, and CONTROL) for ACP security data sets and/or databases are logged, this is not a finding.", "FixText": "Configure ESM READ and/or greater access rules for ESM files and/or databases as limited to system programmers and/or security personnel, and/or batch jobs that perform ACP maintenance. \n\nREAD access can be given to auditors and DASD batch.

The PROFILE DD statement identifies the PROFILE.TCPIP file and the SYSTCPD DD statement identifies the TCPIP.DATA file.\n\nThe location of the TCPIP.DATA file can also be specified by coding the RESOLVER_CONFIG environment variable as a parameter of the ENVAR option in the TCP/IP started task's JCL. In fact, the value of this variable is checked before the SYSTCPD DD statement by some processes. However, not all processes (e.g., TN3270 Telnet Server) will access the variable to get the file location. Therefore specifying the file location explicitly, both on a DD statement and through the RESOLVER_CONFIG environment variable, reduces ambiguity.\n\nThe systems programmer responsible for supporting ICS will ensure that the TCP/IP started task's JCL specifies the PROFILE and SYSTCPD DD statements for the PROFILE.TCPIP and TCPIP.DATA configuration files and TCP/IP started task's JCL includes the RESOLVER_CONFIG variable, set to the name of the file specified on the SYSTCPD DD statement.   \n\nNote:\nIf GLOBALTCPIPDATA is specified, any TCPIP.DATA statements contained in the specified file or data set take precedence over any TCPIP.DATA statements found using the appropriate environment's (native MVS or z/OS UNIX) search order.\n\nIf GLOBALTCPIPDATA is not specified, the appropriate environment's (Native MVS or z/OS UNIX) search order is used to locate TCPIP.DATA.", "CCI": "V-97913,SV-107017,CCI-000366"}, {"VulnID": "V-223605", "RuleID": "SV-223605r836666_rule", "StigID": "ACF2-TC-000070", "Severity": "medium", "Cat": "CAT II", "Classification": "", "GroupTitle": "SRG-OS-000104-GPOS-00051", "RuleTitle": "IBM z/OS Started tasks for the Base TCP/IP component must be defined in accordance with security requirements.", "Description": "<VulnDiscussion>To assure accountability and prevent unauthenticated access, organizational users must be identified and authenticated to prevent potential misuse and compromise of the system.\n\nOrganizational users include organizational employees or individuals the organization deems to have equivalent status of employees (e.g., contractors).
