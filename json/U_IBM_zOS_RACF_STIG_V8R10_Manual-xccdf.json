Identify one or more additional PROCxx DD statements that can contain any other PROCLIB data sets. The concatenation of the additional PROCxx DD statements can contain the same data sets that are identified in the PROCxx DD statement for STC and TSO. The following is an example of the JES2 procedure:\n\n//JES2 PROC \n//IEFPROC EXEC PGM=HASJES20,PARM=NOREQ, \n//DPRTY=(15,15),TIME=1440,PERFORM=9 \n//ALTPARM DD DISP=SHR, \n//DSN=SYS1.PARMLIB(JES2BKUP) \n//HASPPARM DD DISP=SHR, \n//DSN=SYS1.PARMLIB(JES2PARM) \n//PROC00 DD DSN=SYS3.PROCLIB,DISP=SHR \n//DD DSN=SYS2.PROCLIB,DISP=SHR\n//DD DSN=SYS1.PROCLIB,DISP=SHR \n//PROC01 DD DSN=SYS4.USERPROC,DISP=SHR \n//DD DSN=SYS3.PROCLIB,DISP=SHR \n//DD DSN=SYS2.PROCLIB,DISP=SHR \n//DD DSN=SYS1.PROCLIB,DISP=SHR \n//IEFRDER DD SYSOUT=* \n//HASPLIST DD DDNAME=IEFRDER\n\nc. Ensure that the JES2 configuration file is changed to specify that the PROCLIB entry for the STC and TSU JOBCLASSes point to the proper PROCxx entry within the JES2 procedure or JES2 dynamic PROCLIB definitions that contain the STC and/or TSO procedures. All other JOBCLASSes can specify a PROCLIB entry that uses the same PROCxx or any other PROCxx DD statement identified in the JES2 procedure or identified in the JES2 dynamic PROCLIB definitions. The following is an example of the JES2 initialization parameters:\n\nJOBCLASS(*) ACCT=NO, /* ACCT # NOT REQUIRED (DEF.)*/ \n...\nPROCLIB=01, /* DEFAULT TO //PROC01 DD (DEF.)*/\n...\nJOBCLASS(STC) AUTH=ALL, /* ALLOW ALL COMMANDS (DEF.)*/ \n...\nPROCLIB=00, /* USE //PROC00 DD (DEF.)*/ \n...\nJOBCLASS(TSU) AUTH=ALL, /* ALLOW ALL COMMANDS (DEF.)*/\n...\nPROCLIB=00, /* USE //PROC00 DD (DEF.)*/ \n...\n\nd.
