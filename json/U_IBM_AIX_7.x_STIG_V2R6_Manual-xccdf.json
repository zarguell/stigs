If the audit reduction capability does not support after-the-fact investigations, it is difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events leading up to an outage or attack, or identify those responses for one. This capability is also required to comply with applicable Federal laws and DoD policies.\n\nAudit reduction is a process that manipulates collected audit information and organizes such information in a summary format that is more meaningful to analysts. The report generation capability provided by the application must support on-demand (i.e., customizable, ad hoc, and as-needed) reports.\n\nThis requires operating systems to provide the capability to customize audit record reports based on all available criteria.\n\nSatisfies: SRG-OS-000054-GPOS-00025, SRG-OS-000122-GPOS-00063, SRG-OS-000348-GPOS-00136, SRG-OS-000349-GPOS-00137", "FalsePositives": "", "FalseNegatives": "", "Documentable": "false", "Mitigations": "", "SeverityOverrideGuidance": "", "PotentialImpacts": "", "ThirdPartyTools": "", "MitigationControl": "", "Responsibility": "", "IAControls": "", "CheckText": "The application file \"/usr/sbin/auditselect\" provides the audit filtering function.

A logical session (for local, network, and remote access) is initiated whenever a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) accesses an organizational information system. Such user sessions can be terminated (and thus terminate user access) without terminating network sessions.\n\nSession termination terminates all processes associated with a user's logical session except those processes that are specifically created by the user (i.e., session owner) to continue after the session is terminated.\n\nIf a maintenance session or connection remains open after maintenance is completed, it may be hijacked by an attacker and used to compromise or damage the system.\n\nSome maintenance and test tools are either standalone devices with their own operating systems or are applications bundled with an operating system.\n\nConditions or trigger events requiring automatic session termination can include, for example, organization-defined periods of user inactivity, targeted responses to certain types of incidents, and time-of-day restrictions on information system use.\n\nThis capability is typically reserved for specific operating system functionality where the system owner, data owner, or organization requires additional assurance.\n\nTerminating network connections associated with communications sessions includes, for example, de-allocating associated TCP/IP address/port pairs at AIX level, and de-allocating networking assignments at the application level if multiple application sessions are using a single operating system-level network connection. This does not mean that AIX terminates all sessions or network access; it only ends the inactive session and releases the resources associated with that session.\n\n\nSatisfies: SRG-OS-000279-GPOS-00109, SRG-OS-000163-GPOS-00072, SRG-OS-000126-GPOS-00066", "FalsePositives": "", "FalseNegatives": "", "Documentable": "false", "Mitigations": "", "SeverityOverrideGuidance": "", "PotentialImpacts": "", "ThirdPartyTools": "", "MitigationControl": "", "Responsibility": "", "IAControls": "", "CheckText": "Check if \"TMOUT\" and \"TIMEOUT\" environment variables are set to \"600\" (in seconds) in \"/etc/profile\" file:\n\n# grep -E \" TMOUT|TIMEOUT\" /etc/profile\nreadonly TMOUT=600; readonly TIMEOUT=600; export TMOUT TIMEOUT\n\nIf they are not set in \"/etc/profile\" file, are commented out, or their values are greater than \"600\", this is a finding.", "FixText": "Add or update the following line in the \"/etc/profile\" file:\nreadonly TMOUT=600; readonly TIMEOUT=600; export TMOUT TIMEOUT", "CCI": "V-91493,SV-101591,CCI-000879,CCI-001133,CCI-002361"}, {"VulnID": "V-215321", "RuleID": "SV-215321r508663_rule", "StigID": "AIX7-00-003004", "Severity": "medium", "Cat": "CAT II", "Classification": "", "GroupTitle": "SRG-OS-000067-GPOS-00035", "RuleTitle": "AIX SSH private host key files must have mode 0600 or less permissive.", "Description": "<VulnDiscussion>If the private key is discovered, an attacker can use the key to authenticate as an authorized user and gain access to the network infrastructure.\n\nThe cornerstone of the PKI is the private key used to encrypt or digitally sign information.\n\nIf the private key is stolen, this will lead to the compromise of the authentication and non-repudiation gained through PKI because the attacker can use the private key to digitally sign documents and pretend to be the authorized user.\n\nBoth the holders of a digital certificate and the issuing authority must protect the computers, storage devices, or whatever they use to keep the private keys.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>", "VulnDiscussion": "If the private key is discovered, an attacker can use the key to authenticate as an authorized user and gain access to the network infrastructure.\n\nThe cornerstone of the PKI is the private key used to encrypt or digitally sign information.\n\nIf the private key is stolen, this will lead to the compromise of the authentication and non-repudiation gained through PKI because the attacker can use the private key to digitally sign documents and pretend to be the authorized user.\n\nBoth the holders of a digital certificate and the issuing authority must protect the computers, storage devices, or whatever they use to keep the private keys.", "FalsePositives": "", "FalseNegatives": "", "Documentable": "false", "Mitigations": "", "SeverityOverrideGuidance": "", "PotentialImpacts": "", "ThirdPartyTools": "", "MitigationControl": "", "Responsibility": "", "IAControls": "", "CheckText": "Check the permissions for SSH private host key files: \n# ls -lL /etc/ssh/*key \n\nThe above command should yield the following output:\n-rw-------    1 root     system          668 Jan 18 2017  /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key\n-rw-------    1 root     system          227 Jan 18 2017  /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key\n-rw-------    1 root     system          965 Jan 18 2017  /etc/ssh/ssh_host_key\n-rw-------    1 root     system         1675 Jan 18 2017  /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key\n\nIf any file has a mode more permissive than \"0600\", this is a finding.", "FixText": "Change the permissions for the SSH private host key files:\n# chmod 0600 /etc/ssh/*key", "CCI": "V-91279,SV-101377,CCI-000186"}, {"VulnID": "V-215322", "RuleID": "SV-215322r508663_rule", "StigID": "AIX7-00-003005", "Severity": "high", "Cat": "CAT I", "Classification": "", "GroupTitle": "SRG-OS-000074-GPOS-00042", "RuleTitle": "AIX must disable /usr/bin/rcp,\n/usr/bin/rlogin,\n/usr/bin/rsh, /usr/bin/rexec and /usr/bin/telnet commands.", "Description": "<VulnDiscussion>The listed applications permit the transmission of passwords in plain text.
