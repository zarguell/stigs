If a malicious user repurposes an ActiveX control to take over a user's computer, the effect could be significant.\nTo help improve security, ActiveX developers can mark controls as Safe For Initialization (SFI), which means that the developer states that the controls are safe to open and run and not capable of causing harm to any computers. If a control is not marked SFI, the control could adversely affect a computer--or it could mean the developers did not test the control in all situations and are not sure whether their control might be compromised at some future date.\nSFI controls run in safe mode, which limits their access to the computer. For example, a worksheet control can both read and write files when it is in unsafe mode, but perhaps only read from files when it is in safe mode. This functionality allows the control to be used in very powerful ways when safety is not important, but the control would still be safe for use in a Web page.\nIf a control is not marked as SFI, it is marked Unsafe For Initialization (UFI), which means that it is capable of affecting a user's computer. If UFI ActiveX controls are loaded, they are always loaded in unsafe mode.", "FalsePositives": "", "FalseNegatives": "", "Documentable": "false", "Mitigations": "", "SeverityOverrideGuidance": "", "PotentialImpacts": "", "ThirdPartyTools": "", "MitigationControl": "", "Responsibility": "", "IAControls": "", "CheckText": "Verify the policy value for User Configuration >> Administrative Templates >> Microsoft Office 2013 >> Security Settings \"Load Controls in Forms3\" is set to \"Disabled\".\n\nUse the Windows Registry Editor to navigate to the following HKCU\\keycupoliciesmsvbasecurity \n\nIf the value 'LoadControlsInForms' exists, this is a finding.", "FixText": "Set the policy value for User Configuration -> Administrative Templates -> Microsoft Office 2013 -> Security Settings \"Load Controls in Forms3\" to \"Disabled\".", "CCI": "SV-52729,V-17750,CCI-001662"}, {"VulnID": "V-228553", "RuleID": "SV-228553r508020_rule", "StigID": "DTOO413", "Severity": "medium", "Cat": "CAT II", "Classification": "", "GroupTitle": "SRG-APP-000131", "RuleTitle": "Users must be prevented from using or inserting apps that come from the Office Store.", "Description": "<VulnDiscussion>This policy setting allows users to be prevented from using or inserting apps that come from the Office Store.
