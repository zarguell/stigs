Frequent alerts against this counter may indicate a network or other issue (such as inbound SPAMMER traffic) that directly impacts email delivery. \n\nNotification choices include email alert to an email-enabled account, for example, an email Administrator, or invoke a script to take other action, for example, to add an Event to the Microsoft Application Event Log, where external monitors might detect it.", "FalsePositives": "", "FalseNegatives": "", "Documentable": "false", "Mitigations": "", "SeverityOverrideGuidance": "", "PotentialImpacts": "", "ThirdPartyTools": "", "MitigationControl": "", "Responsibility": "", "IAControls": "", "CheckText": "Note: If a third-party application is performing monitoring functions, the reviewer should verify the application is monitoring correctly and mark the vulnerability not applicable.\n\nOpen the Exchange Management Shell and enter the following command:\n\nperfmon\n\nIn the left pane, expand and navigate Performance >> Data Collector Sets >> User Defined. \n\nIf no sets are defined or queues are not being monitored, this is a finding.", "FixText": "Open the Exchange Management Shell and enter the following command:\n\nperfmon\n\nIn the left pane, navigate to and select Performance >> Data Collector Sets >> User Defined.\n\nRight-click, navigate to, and configure User Defined >> New >> Data Collector Set to use user-defined data collection for monitoring the queues.", "CCI": "SV-84357,V-69735,CCI-000154"}, {"VulnID": "V-234776", "RuleID": "SV-234776r617269_rule", "StigID": "EX13-CA-000060", "Severity": "medium", "Cat": "CAT II", "Classification": "", "GroupTitle": "SRG-APP-000141", "RuleTitle": "Exchange must have Send Fatal Errors to Microsoft disabled.", "Description": "<VulnDiscussion>Log files help establish a history of activities, and can be useful in detecting attack attempts or determining tuning adjustments to improve availability.
