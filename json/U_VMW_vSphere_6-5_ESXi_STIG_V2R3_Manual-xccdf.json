When this is done only a single day's worth of logs are stored at any time. In addition log files will be reinitialized upon each reboot.  This presents a security risk as user activity logged on the host is only stored temporarily and will not persistent across reboots.  This can also complicate auditing and make it harder to monitor events and diagnose issues.  ESXi host logging should always be configured to a persistent datastore.\n\nNote: Scratch space is configured automatically during installation or first boot of an ESXi host, and does not usually need to be manually configured. ESXi Installable creates a 4 GB Fat16 partition on the target device during installation if there is sufficient space, and if the device is considered Local.  If ESXi is installed on an SD card or USB device a persistent log location may not be configured upon install as normal.",
