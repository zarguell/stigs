Ensure the following WebSphere MQ resource classes are defined to the TSS RDT:

MQADMIN
MQCONN
MQCMDS
MQNLIST
MQPROC
MQQUEUE

For V7.0.0 and above:

MXADMIN
MXNLIST
MXPROC
MXQUEUE
MXTOPIC

Ensure that each ssid. resource is defined in each of the above resource classes.

NOTE:	ssid is the queue manager name (a.k.a., subsystem identifier).

NOTE:	If both MQADMIN and MXADMIN resource classes are not defined to the RDT record, no security checking is performed.","The IAO will ensure that all WebSphere MQ resources are defined to TSS.

MQADMIN
MQCONN
MQCMDS
MQNLIST
MQPROC
MQQUEUE

For V7.0.0 and above:

MXADMIN

Use the following commands to define (establish ownership of) resources for each WebSphere MQ subsystem to TSS:

TSS ADD(deptname) MQADMIN(ssid.)
TSS ADD(deptname) MQCMDS(ssid.)
TSS ADD(deptname) MQCONN(ssid.)
TSS ADD(deptname) MQNLIST(ssid.)

NOTE: ssid is the queue manager name (a.k.a., subsystem identifier).

Another method to ensure protection is to assign the DEFPROT attribute to the resource class in the RDT record by using the following command:

d) If any item in (b) is untrue, this is a finding.","The systems programmer responsible for supporting MQSeries/WebSphere MQ will ensure that the dead-letter queue and its alias are properly defined.

The following scenario describes how to securely define a dead-letter queue:

(1)	Define the real dead-letter queue with attributes PUT(ENABLED) and GET(ENABLED).

(2)	Give update authority for the dead-letter queue to CKTI (the MQSeries/WebSphere MQ-supplied CICS task initiator), channel initiators, and any automated application used for dead-letter queue maintenance.

(3)	Define an alias queue that resolves to the real dead-letter queue, but give the alias queue the attributes PUT(ENABLED) and GET(DISABLED).

(4)	To put a message on the dead-letter queue, an application uses the alias queue. The application does the following:

(a)	Retrieve the name of the real dead-letter queue. To do this, it opens the queue manager object using MQOPEN, and then issues an MQINQ to get the dead-letter queue name.

(b)	Build the name of the alias queue by appending the characters "".PUT"" to this name, in this case, ssid.DEAD.QUEUE.PUT.

(c)	Open the alias queue, ssid.DEAD.QUEUE.PUT.

(d)	Put the message on the real dead-letter queue by issuing an MQPUT against the alias queue.

(5)	Give the userid associated with the application update authority to the alias, but no access to the real dead-letter queue.

NOTE:	If an alias queue is not used in place of the dead-letter queue, then the ACP rules for the dead-letter queue will be coded to restrict unauthorized users and systems from reading the messages on the file.

Undeliverable messages can be routed to a dead-letter queue. Two levels of access should be established for these queues. The first level allows applications, as well as some MQSeries / WebSphere MQ objects, to put messages to this queue. The second level restricts the ability to get messages from this queue and protects sensitive data. This will be accomplished by defining an alias queue that resolves to the real dead-letter queue, but defines the alias queue with the attributes PUT(ENABLED) and GET(DISABLED). The ability to get messages from the dead-letter queue will be restricted to message channel agents (MCAs), CKTI (MQSeries/WebSphere MQ-supplied CICS task initiator), channel initiators utility, and any automated application used for dead-letter queue maintenance.","V-6964,SV-7267,CCI-001762,CCI-000764"
