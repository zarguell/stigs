Review the router configuration to verify that stateless firewall filters are configured to allow or deny traffic for specific source and destination addresses as well as ports and protocols. Verify the IP addresses are appropriate for the target environment. IP addresses are configured in lists at [edit policy-options] or are directly embedded into each term.

[edit policy-options]

    <inside IPv4 subnet>/<mask>;
    <inside IPv4 subnet>/<mask>;
}
prefix-list inside-addresses-ipv6 {

For example:
[edit firewall]

Verify filters are applied to the correct interface. For example, the ""authorized-outbound"" filter, as written, should be applied to the ingress of internal interfaces:
[edit interfaces]
<internal interface name> {                             
    unit <number> {

            filter {                    
                input authorized-outbound-ipv4;             
            }                           
            address <IPv4 address>/<mask>;       
        }                               
        family inet6 {                   
            filter {                    
                input authorized-outbound-ipv6;             
            }                           
            address <IPv6 address>/<prefix>;       
        }                               
    }                                   
} 
Note: Some Juniper devices support both monolithic filters and filter lists. Filter lists separate each term, or set of terms, into a separate filter that is applied sequentially to an interface. If using filter lists, the keywords ""input"" and ""output"" change to ""input-list"" or ""output-list"". Verify the final list item is a deny-all filter. 

If the router is not configured to enforce approved authorizations for controlling the flow of information within the network based on organization-defined information flow control policies, this is a finding.","This requirement is not applicable for the DODIN Backbone.

Configure stateless firewall filters to allow or deny traffic for specific source and destination addresses as well as ports and protocols.

Example prefix-lists:

Review the configuration of each router interface connecting to an alternate gateway.

Verify each permit statement of the ingress filter only permits packets with destination addresses of the site's NIPRNet address space or a destination address belonging to the address block assigned by the alternate gateway network service provider. Verify each permit statement ""from"" stanza (filter match conditions) references either the ""destination-address"" or ""destination-prefix-list"" directive. Using prefix lists makes management easier because managing interior addresses must only be configured in one location (the prefix-list) vice many locations (each permitting filter term). For example:
[edit policy-options]
prefix-list inside_addresses-ipv4 {
    <IPv4 subnet / mask>;
}
prefix-list inside_addresses-ipv6 {
    <IPv6 subnet / prefix>;
}
[edit firewall]
family inet {
    filter inbound-ipv4 {
        <deny terms>;
        permit-term1 {
            from {
                <match conditions>;
                destination-prefix-list inside_addresses-ipv4;
            }
            then accept;
        }
        <additional permit terms with a destination address definition>
    }
}
family inet6 {
    filter inbound-ipv6 {
        <deny terms>;
        permit-term1 {
            from {
                <match conditions>;
                destination-prefix-list inside_addresses-ipv6;
            }
            then accept;
        }
        <additional permit terms with a destination address definition>
    }
}

Verify the filter is applied inbound on exterior-facing interfaces. For example:
[edit interfaces]
<interface name> {
    unit <number> {
        family inet {
            filter {
                input inbound-ipv4;
            }
            address <IPv4 address / mask>;
        }
        family inet6 {
            filter {
                input inbound-ipv6;
            }
            address <IPv6 address / prefix>;
        }
    }
}

Note: Some Juniper devices support both monolithic filters and filter lists. Filter lists separate each term, or set of terms, into a separate filter that is applied sequentially to an interface. If using filter lists, the keywords ""input"" or ""output"" change to ""input-list"" or ""output-list"". Verify the final list item is a deny-all filter.

Review the router configuration to verify that the firewall filter is configured to allow specific ports and protocols and deny all other traffic. Associating any firewall filter to an interface will create a deny-all, permit-by-exception posture because each filter includes an implicit ""deny all"" final term. Verify firewall filters applied inbound on external interfaces are configured with terms permitting specific traffic.

For example:
[edit firewall]
family inet {
    filter permitted_inbound_traffic_ipv4 {
        term 1 {
            from {
                destination-prefix-list {
                    INSIDE_ADDRESSES_IPv4;
                }

                destination-port [ http https ];
            }
            then accept;
        }
        term 2 {
            from {
                destination-prefix-list {
                    INSIDE_ADDRESSES_IPv4;
                }
                protocol udp;
                destination-port [ domain radius ];
            }
            then accept;
        }
    }
}
family inet6 {
    filter permitted_inbound_traffic_ipv6 {
        term 1 {
            from {
                destination-prefix-list {
                    INSIDE_ADDRESSES_IPv6;
                }
                next-header tcp;
                destination-port [ http https ];
            }
            then accept;
        }
        term 2 {
            from {
                destination-prefix-list {
                    INSIDE_ADDRESSES_IPv6;
                }
                next-header udp;
                destination-port [ domain radius ];
            }
            then accept;
        }
    }
}

Note: Although the example filter is sufficient to meet this requirement, an explicit ""deny-all"" term is required for logging. For example, add the following final term to both filters (IPv4 and IPv6) to enable logging of discarded packets:
[edit firewall family (inet|inet6) filter <name>]
term default {
    then {
        log;
        syslog;
        discard;
    }
}

The filter must be configured inbound on all external interfaces.
[edit interfaces]
<external interface> {
    unit <number> {
        family inet {
            filter input permitted_inbound_traffic_ipv4;
            address <IPv4 address/mask>;
        }
        family inet6 {
            filter input permitted_inbound_traffic_ipv6;
            address <IPv6 address/prefix>;
        }
}
Note: Some Juniper devices support both monolithic filters and filter lists. Filter lists separate each term, or set of terms, into a separate filter that is applied sequentially to an interface. If using filter lists, the keywords ""input"" or ""output"" change to ""input-list"" or ""output-list"". Verify the final list item is a deny-all filter. The deny-all filter is created once per family and can be reused across multiple lists. For example:

input-list [ permit_mgt permit_routing_protocols default-deny ];

If the filter is not configured to allow specific ports and protocols and deny all other traffic, this is a finding.

If the filter is not configured inbound on all external interfaces, this is a finding.","This requirement is not applicable for the DODIN Backbone.

Configure the perimeter router to deny network traffic by default and allow network traffic by exception. For example:

set firewall family inet filter permitted_inbound_traffic_ipv4 term 1 from destination-prefix-list INSIDE_ADDRESSES
set firewall family inet filter permitted_inbound_traffic_ipv4 term 1 from protocol tcp
set firewall family inet filter permitted_inbound_traffic_ipv4 term 1 from destination-port http

set firewall family inet filter permitted_inbound_traffic_ipv4 term 2 from protocol udp
set firewall family inet filter permitted_inbound_traffic_ipv4 term 2 from destination-port domain
set firewall family inet filter permitted_inbound_traffic_ipv4 term 2 from destination-port radius
set firewall family inet filter permitted_inbound_traffic_ipv4 term 2 then accept

set firewall family inet6 filter permitted_inbound_traffic_ipv6 term 1 from destination-prefix-list INSIDE_ADDRESSES
set firewall family inet6 filter permitted_inbound_traffic_ipv6 term 1 from next-header tcp

set firewall family inet6 filter permitted_inbound_traffic_ipv6 term 2 from destination-port radius
set firewall family inet6 filter permitted_inbound_traffic_ipv6 term 2 then accept

Note: Additional match criteria includes protocol (next-header for IPv6), source and destination ports, ICMP type and code, etc. When applied to the loopback interface, the filter affects identified traffic regardless of ingress interface. Ensure the filter addresses all traffic destined to the RE like routing protocols, ICMP messages, SSH and SCP traffic, SNMP, etc.

Verify filters are applied to loopback, all L3 interfaces, or both. For example:

If the router is not configured with a receive-path filter to restrict traffic destined to itself, this is a finding.

Note: If the platform does not support the receive path filter, verify that all layer 3 interfaces have an ingress firewall filter to control what packets are allowed to be destined to the router for processing.","Configure all routers with receive path filters to restrict traffic destined to the router.

                input cust1-prefixes-ipv4;

            address <IPv4 address>/<mask>;       
        }                               
        family inet6 {                  
            filter {                    
                input cust1-prefixes-ipv6;
            }

    }                                   
}

Note: Some Juniper devices support both monolithic filters and filter lists. Filter lists separate each term, or set of terms, into a separate filter that is applied sequentially to an interface. If using filter lists, the keywords ""input"" or ""output"" change to ""input-list"" or ""output-list"". Verify the final list item is a deny-all filter. The deny-all filter is created once per family and can be reused across multiple lists. For example:

input-list [ permit_mgt permit_routing_protocols default-deny ];

If uRPF or an ingress firewall filter is not enabled on all CE-facing interfaces, this is a finding.","Enable uRPF loose mode or apply an ingress filter on all CE-facing interfaces.

            }
            address <IPv6 address>/<prefix>;
        }
    }
}

Note: Some Juniper devices support both monolithic filters and filter lists. Filter lists separate each term, or set of terms, into a separate filter that is applied sequentially to an interface. If using filter lists, the keywords ""input"" or ""output"" change to ""input-list"" or ""output-list"". Verify the final list item is a deny-all filter. The deny-all filter is created once per family and can be reused across multiple lists. For example:

input-list [ permit_mgt permit_routing_protocols default-deny ];

If the router does not restrict traffic that ingresses and egresses the management interface, this is a finding.","If the management interface is a routed interface, it must be configured with both an ingress and egress ACL.

[edit interfaces]

For those platforms that do not support uRPF, verify an egress stateless firewall filter is applied to all internal interfaces. In this example, the egress (from the enclave) filter is applied in the input direction of internal interfaces to prevent the router from accepting packets sourced from any address except the internal subnets. For example:
[edit policy-options]
prefix-list internal-prefixes-ipv4 {
    192.0.2.0/24;
}
prefix-list internal-prefixes-ipv6 {
    2001:0:2::/64;

            }
        }
    }
}
family inet6 {
    filter internal-inbound-ipv6 {
        term 1 {
            from {
                source-prefix-list {
                    internal-prefixes-ipv6;

        }                               
        family inet6 {                  
            filter {                    
                input internal-inbound-ipv6;
            }                           
            address <IPv6 address>/<prefix>;

Verify the Juniper router is not configured with the factory default configuration. The Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) feature requires the factory default configuration. Juniper ZTP leverages Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) options to provide not only the interface address, but also the location of the upgrade image and configuration file. Interfaces configured for DHCP will not attempt to establish a ZTP session simply because DHCP is enabled but, instead, also require a factory default configuration. Therefore, if DHCP is authorized, removing the following [edit system] options, setting a root password, and committing will prevent the device from attempting ZTP.

Verify the following are removed.

If a configuration auto-loading feature or zero-touch deployment feature is enabled, this is a finding.

Note: Auto-configuration or zero-touch deployment features can be enabled when the router is offline for the purpose of image loading or building out the configuration.

Initiated by an attacker or a misconfigured router, prefix deaggregation occurs when the announcement of a large prefix is fragmented into a collection of smaller prefix announcements.

In 1997, misconfigured routers in the Florida Internet Exchange network (AS7007) deaggregated every prefix in their routing table and started advertising the first /24 block of each of these prefixes as their own. Faced with this additional burden, the internal routers became overloaded and crashed repeatedly. This caused prefixes advertised by these routers to disappear from routing tables and reappear when the routers came back online. As the routers came back after crashing, they were flooded with the routing table information by their neighbors. The flood of information would again overwhelm the routers and cause them to crash. This process of route flapping served to destabilize not only the surrounding network but also the entire internet. Routers trying to reach those addresses would choose the smaller, more specific /24 blocks first. This caused backbone networks throughout North America and Europe to crash.

Maximum prefix limits on peer connections combined with aggressive prefix-size filtering of customers' reachability advertisements will effectively mitigate the deaggregation risk.

Note: Some Juniper devices support both monolithic filters and filter lists. Filter lists separate each term, or set of terms, into a separate filter that is applied sequentially to an interface. If using filter lists, the keywords ""input"" or ""output"" change to ""input-list"" or ""output-list"". Verify the final list item is a deny-all filter. The deny-all filter is created once per family and can be reused across multiple lists. For example:

Verify that the ingress filter is blocking packets with Bogon source addresses. Bogon addresses are added to prefix lists to ease management, and prefix lists are associated with firewall filters. Verify appropriate prefix lists for IPv4 and IPv6 Bogon addresses. For example:

Note: The comments associated with addresses is configured with the ""annotate"" command. Annotations will appear in the standard hierarchical configuration display but do not appear when using ""display set"". The annotations are not required but added to this check to show what each address represents.

Verify IPv4 and IPv6 firewall filters incorporate Bogon address restrictions.
[edit firewall]
family inet {
    filter inbound-ipv4 {
        term 1 {
            from {
                source-prefix-list bogon-ipv4;
            }
            then {
                log;
                syslog;
                discard;
            }
        }
        <permitted traffic terms>
    }
}
family inet6 {
    filter inbound-ipv6 {
        term 1 {
            from {
                source-prefix-list bogon-ipv6;
            }
            then {
                log;
                syslog;
                discard;
            }
        }
        <permitted traffic terms>
    }
}

Review the router configuration to verify that it is configured to block IP packets with a Bogon source address. Verify the firewall filter enforcing Bogon restrictions is applied inbound on exterior-facing interfaces. For example:
[edit interfaces]
<interface name> {
    unit <number> {
        family inet {
            filter {
                input inbound-ipv4;
            }
            address <IPv4 address>/<mask>;
        }
        family inet6 {
            filter {
                input inbound-ipv6;
            }
            address <IPv6 address>/<prefix>;
        }
    }
}
Note: Some Juniper devices support both monolithic filters and filter lists. Filter lists separate each term, or set of terms, into a separate filter that is applied sequentially to an interface. If using filter lists, the keywords ""input"" or ""output"" change to ""input-list"" or ""output-list"". Verify the final list item is a deny-all filter. The deny-all filter is created once per family and can be reused across multiple lists. For example:

input-list [ permit_mgt permit_routing_protocols default-deny ];

If the router is not configured to block inbound IP packets containing a Bogon source address, this is a finding.

Note: At a minimum, IP packets containing a source address from the special purpose address space as defined in RFC 6890 must be blocked. The 6Bone prefix (3ffe::/16) is also be considered a Bogon address. Perimeter routers connected to commercial ISPs for internet or other non-DoD network sources will need to be reviewed for a full Bogon list. 

The IPv4 full Bogon list contains prefixes that have been allocated to RIRs but not assigned by those RIRs. Reference the following link: http://www.team-cymru.org/Services/Bogons/fullbogons-ipv4.txt

The IPv6 full Bogon list contains prefixes that have not been allocated to RIRs, or those that have been allocated to RIRs but have not been assigned by those RIRs. Reference the following link: https://www.team-cymru.org/Services/Bogons/fullbogons-ipv6.txt","This requirement is not applicable for the DODIN Backbone.

Review all router configurations to ensure LLDPs are not included in the global configuration or LLDPs are not included for each active external interface. Examples of LLDPs are Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP), Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP), and Link Layer Discovery Protocol - Media Endpoint Discovery (LLDP-MED). Junos does not support CDP, but supports both LLDP and LLDP-MED, configured at [edit protocols]. Verify external interfaces are either not configured or explicitly disabled. For example:

To globally disable LLDP and LLDP-MED:
[edit protocols]
<no LLDP or LLDP-MED hierarchy>
-or-
lldp {
    interface all {
        disable;
    }
}
lldp-med {
    interface all {
        disable;
    }
}

If LLDP or LLDP-MED is authorized, verify external interfaces are not configured or are explicitly disabled. For example:
[edit protocols]
lldp {
    interface all {
        disable;
    }
    interface ge-0/0/0; <<< Verify ge-0/0/0 is not an external interface.
    interface ge-0/0/1 {
        disable; <<< Assuming ge-0/0/1 is an external interface, it is disabled globally (interface all disable) or explicitly disabled as shown.
    }
}
lldp-med {
    interface all {
        disable;
    interface ge-0/0/0; <<< Verify ge-0/0/0 is not an external interface.
    interface ge-0/0/1 {
        disable; <<< Assuming ge-0/0/1 is an external interface, it is disabled globally (interface all disable) or explicitly disabled as shown.
    }
}

Note: Both LLDP and LLDP-MED are globally disabled on all interfaces but Junos will apply the most specific configuration. Therefore, both LLDP and LLDP-MED are enabled only on ge-0/0/0 and disabled on all other interfaces as configured in the example.

If LLDPs are configured globally or on any external interface, this is a finding.","This requirement is not applicable for the DODIN Backbone.

Disable LLDPs on all external interfaces.

set protocols lldp interface <interior interface>
set protocols lldp interface <exterior interface> disable

set protocols lldp-med interface all disable
set protocols lldp-med interface <interior interface>
set protocols lldp-med interface <exterior interface> disable

Note: The <exterior interface> disable command is not required if LLDP and LLDP-MED are globally disabled. However, the configured protocol status may be more apparent if each exterior interface is explicitly disabled.","CCI-002403"

Note: Some platforms support the ""port"" match criterion. For those platforms, only a single term is required to flag on both source- and destination-port. For example:
[edit firewall]
family [inet|inet6] {
    filter <name> {
        term <name> {
            from {
                :
                port [ port1 port2... ];
            }
            then {
                syslog;
                discard;
            }
        }
        <additional terms>
    }
}

Verify the filter is applied to external interfaces.
[edit interfaces]
<external interface> {
    unit <number> {
        family inet {
            filter {
                output <name>;
            }
            address <IPv4 address>/<mask>;
        }
        family inet6 {
            filter {
                output <name>;
            }
            address <IPv6 address>/<prefix>;
        }
    }
}
Note: Some Juniper devices support both monolithic filters and filter lists. Filter lists separate each term, or set of terms, into a separate filter that is applied sequentially to an interface. If using filter lists, the keywords ""input"" or ""output"" change to ""input-list"" or ""output-list"". Verify the final list item is a deny-all filter. The deny-all filter is created once per family and can be reused across multiple lists. For example:

input-list [ permit_mgt permit_routing_protocols default-deny ];

Configure the perimeter router of the managed network with a firewall filter on the egress interface to block all outbound management traffic.

LDP signaled VPLS requires a full mesh topology, which can lead to scaling issues.
