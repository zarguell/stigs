Note: A network analysis policy governs how traffic is decoded and preprocessed so that it can be further evaluated for anomalous traffic that might signal an intrusion attempt. An intrusion policy uses intrusion and preprocessor rules (sometimes referred to collectively as intrusion rules) to examine the decoded packets for attacks based on patterns.

Logging is recording data about events that take place in a system, while auditing is the use of log records to identify security-relevant information such as system or user accesses. In short, log records are audited to establish an accurate history. Without logging, it would be impossible to establish an audit trail.

The IDPS must have the capability to collect and log the severity associated with the policy, rule, or signature. IDPS products often have either pre-configured and/or a configurable method for associating an impact indicator or severity code with signatures and rules, at a minimum.","","","false","","","","","","","","Step 1: Navigate to Configuration >> ASA Firepower Configuration >> Policies >> Actions Alerts.

CJCSM 6510.01B, ""Cyber Incident Handling Program"", lists nine Cyber Incident and Reportable Event Categories. DoD has determined that categories identified by CJCSM 6510.01B Major Indicators (category I, II, IV, and VII detection events) will require an alert when an event is detected.

Alerts messages must include a severity level indicator or code as an indicator of the criticality of the incident. Since these incidents require immediate action, these messages are assigned a critical or level 1 priority/severity, depending on the system's priority schema.

Alerts may be transmitted, for example, telephonically, by electronic mail messages, or by text messaging. The IDPS must either send the alert to a management console that is actively monitored by authorized personnel or use a messaging capability to send the alert directly to designated personnel. The ISSM or ISSO may designate the firewall administrator and/or other authorized personnel to receive the alert within the specified time, validate the alert, and then forward only validated alerts to the ISSM and ISSO.","","","false","","","","","","","","Verify email server and email addresses have been defined.
