Windows 2008 R2 or later: 

Open ""Windows PowerShell"".

Enter ""Get-ADDomain -Identity [Forest Root Domain] | FT PDCEmulator"", where [Forest Root Domain] is the forest root domain name, such as ""example.mil"". (This can also be entered without the -Identity parameter if running within the forest root domain.)

Select ""Action"" in the menu, then ""All Tasks >> Operations Masters"".

Select the ""PDC"" tab.

On the system with the PDC Emulator role, open ""Windows PowerShell"" or an elevated ""Command Prompt"" (run as administrator).

Enter ""W32tm /query /configuration"".
