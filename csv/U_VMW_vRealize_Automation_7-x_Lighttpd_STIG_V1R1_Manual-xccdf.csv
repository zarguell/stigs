Remote access can be used to access hosted applications or to perform management functions. A web server can be accessed remotely and must be capable of restricting access from what the DoD defines as nonsecure zones. Nonsecure zones are defined as any IP, subnet, or region that is defined as a threat to the organization. The nonsecure zones must be defined for public web servers logically located in a DMZ, as well as private web servers with perimeter protection devices. By restricting access from nonsecure zones, through internal web server access list, the web server can stop or slow denial of service (DoS) attacks on the web server.

As the web server for the vRA Virtual Appliance Management Interface (vAMI), Lighttpd is the primary remote access management system for vRA. Lighttpd must be configured to restrict inbound connections from nonsecure zones. To accomplish this, the SSL engine must be enabled.
