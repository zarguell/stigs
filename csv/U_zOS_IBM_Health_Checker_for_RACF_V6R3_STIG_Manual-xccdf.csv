Verify that the accesses to the IBM Health Checker STC data sets are properly restricted. If the following guidance is true, this is not a finding.

___ The RACF data set rules for the data sets restricts READ access to auditors.

___ The RACF data set rules for the data sets restricts UPDATE access to domain level security administrators.

___ The RACF data set rules for the data sets restricts WRITE and/or greater access to systems programming personnel.

___ The RACF data set rules for the data sets restricts WRITE and/or greater access to the IBM Health Checker's STC(s) and/or batch user(s).

___ The RACF data set rules for the data sets specify UACC(NONE) and NOWARNING.","The ISSO will ensure that WRITE and/or greater access to IBM Health Checker STC data sets is limited to systems programmers and/or Quest NC-Pass's STC(s) and/or batch user(s) only. READ access can be given to auditors.

The installing systems programmer will identify and document the product data sets and categorize them according to who will have WRITE and/or greater access and if required that all WRITE and/or greater access is logged. The installing systems programmer will identify if any additional groups have WRITE and/or greater access for specific data sets, and once documented will work with the ISSO to ensure they are properly restricted to the ACP (Access Control Program) active on the system. The dataset to be protected can be found in the HZSPROC STC member in HZSPDATA DD statement.

Data sets to be protected will be:
SYS3.*.HZSPDATA

The following commands are provided as a sample for implementing data set controls:
