Automated Analysis
Refer to the following report produced by the Data Set and Resource Data Collection:

- PDI(ZHCK0001)

Verify that the accesses to the IBM Health Checker STC data sets are properly restricted. If the following guidance is true, this is not a finding.

___ The ACF2 data set rules for the data sets restricts READ access to auditors.

___ The ACF2 data set rules for the data sets restricts WRITE and/or greater access to systems programming personnel.

___ The ACF2 data set rules for the data sets restricts WRITE and/or greater access to the IBM Health Checker's STC(s) and/or batch user(s).","The ISSO will ensure that WRITE and/or greater access to IBM Health Checker STC data sets is limited to systems programmers and/or IBM Health Checker's STC(s) and/or batch user(s) only. READ access can be given to auditors.

The installing systems programmer will identify and document the product data sets and categorize them according to who will have WRITE and/or greater access and if required that all WRITE and/or greater access is logged. The installing systems programmer will identify if any additional groups have WRITE and/or greater access for specific data sets, and once documented will work with the ISSO to ensure they are properly restricted to the ACP (Access Control Program) active on the system. The dataset to be protected can be found in the HZSPROC STC member in HZSPDATA DD statement.

Data sets to be protected will be:
SYS3.*.HZSPDATA

The following commands are provided as a sample for implementing data set controls:

STC","The IAO working with the systems programmer will ensure the IBM Health Checker Started Task(s) is properly identified and/or defined to the System ACP. 

If the product requires a Started Task, verify that it is properly defined to the System ACP with the proper attributes.
