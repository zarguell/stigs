1. Most transactions are protected in groups. An example would be ""L2TRANS"" which would contain all Category 2 transactions. L2TRANS is defined to RACF as a profile and contains all the Category 2 transactions. An example of how to implement this within RACF is shown here:

RDEF GCICSTRN L2TRANS UACC(NONE) OWNER(ADMIN) AUDIT(ALL(READ))

RALT GCICSTRN L2TRANS ADDMEM(CADP CBAM CDBC)

Permission to the transaction group can be accomplished with a sample command:

PE L2TRANS CL(GCICSTRN) id(<syspaudt>)

Note that a refresh is generally needed to the member class.
