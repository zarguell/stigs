Verify that the accesses to the IBM System Display and Search Facility (SDSF) HASPINDX data set specified on the INDEX control statement in the ISFPARMS statements (identified in the SFSFPARM DD statement of the SDSF stc) are properly restricted.

___       The TSS data set rules for the data sets restricts UPDATE access to SDSF Started Tasks.

___       The TSS data set rules for the data sets restricts WRITE and/or greater access to systems programming personnel.

Note:       If running z/OS V1R11 or above, with the use of a new JES logical log, the HASPINDX, may not exist and may make this vulnerability not applicable (N/A). However if used the HASPINDX dataset must be restricted.

The HASPINDX data set is used by SDSF when building the SYSLOG panel. This data set contains information related to all SYSLOG jobs and data sets on the spool. Since SDSF dynamically allocates this data set, explicit user access authorization to this data set should not be required. Due to the potentially sensitive data in this data set, access authorization will be restricted.

READ access is restricted to the auditors.

UPDATE access is restricted to SDSF Started Tasks.

WRITE and/or greater access is restricted to systems programming personnel.
