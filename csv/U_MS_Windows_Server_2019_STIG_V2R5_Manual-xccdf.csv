Review user account mappings to PKI certificates.

Open ""Windows PowerShell"".

Enter ""Get-ADUser -Filter * | FT Name, UserPrincipalName, Enabled"".

Exclude disabled accounts (e.g., DefaultAccount, Guest) and the krbtgt account.

If the User Principal Name (UPN) is not in the format of an individual's identifier for the certificate type and for the appropriate domain suffix, this is a finding.

For standard NIPRNet certificates, the individual's identifier is in the format of an Electronic Data Interchange - Personnel Identifier (EDI-PI).

Alt Tokens and other certificates may use a different UPN format than the EDI-PI which vary by organization. Verified these with the organization.

NIPRNet Example:

Name - User Principal Name
User1 - 1234567890@mil

See PKE documentation for other network domain suffixes.

Configuration of whitelisting applications will vary by the program.

AppLocker is a whitelisting application built into Windows Server. A deny-by-default implementation is initiated by enabling any AppLocker rules within a category, only allowing what is specified by defined rules.

If AppLocker is used, perform the following to view the configuration of AppLocker:

Open ""PowerShell"".

If the AppLocker PowerShell module has not been imported previously, execute the following first:

Import-Module AppLocker

Execute the following command, substituting [c:\temp\file.xml] with a location and file name appropriate for the system:

Get-AppLockerPolicy -Effective -XML > c:\temp\file.xml

This will produce an xml file with the effective settings that can be viewed in a browser or opened in a program such as Excel for review.

Severity Override Guidance: The AO can allow the severity override if they have reviewed the overall protection provided to the affected servers that are not capable of complying with the Credential Guard requirement. Items that should be reviewed/considered for compliance or mitigation for non-Credential Guard compliance are:

The use of Microsoft Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) or similar products to control different local administrative passwords for all affected servers. This is to include a strict password change requirement (60 days or less).
….
Strict separation of roles and duties. Server administrator credentials cannot be used on Windows 10 desktop to administer it. Documentation of all exceptions should be supplied.
….
Use of a Privileged Access Workstation (PAW) and adherence to the Clean Source principle for administering affected servers. 
….
Boundary Protection that is currently in place to protect from vulnerabilities in the network/servers.
….
Windows Defender rule block credential stealing from LSASS.exe is applied.  This rule can only be applied if Windows Defender is in use.
….
The overall number of vulnerabilities that are unmitigated on the network/servers.","V-93277,SV-103365,CCI-000366"
