Once the web server is installed, the passwords for any created accounts should be changed and documented. The new passwords must meet the requirements for all passwords, i.e., upper/lower characters, numbers, special characters, time until change, reuse policy, etc. 

Normally, a service account is established for OHS.  This is because a privileged account is not desirable and the server is designed to run for long uninterrupted periods of time.  

The SA or Web Manager will need password access to OHS to restart the service in the event of an emergency as OHS is not to restart automatically after an unscheduled interruption.  If the password is not entrusted to an SA or web manager the ability to ensure the availability of OHS is compromised.

Service accounts or system accounts that have no login capability do not need to have passwords set or changed.","","","false","","","","","","","","NOTE: Service accounts or system accounts that have no login capability do not need to have passwords set or changed.

Review the web server documentation and deployment configuration to determine what non-service/system accounts were installed by the web server installation process.

Verify the passwords for these accounts have been set and/or changed from the default passwords.

Verify the SA/Web manager are notified of the changed password.

If these accounts still have no password or have default passwords, this is a finding.
