In addition, quickly terminating an idle SSH session will also free resources committed by the managed network element. 
 
Terminating network connections associated with communications sessions includes, for example, de-allocating associated TCP/IP address/port pairs at the operating system level and deallocating networking assignments at the application level if multiple application sessions are using a single operating system-level network connection. This does not mean that the operating system terminates all sessions or network access; it only ends the inactive session and releases the resources associated with that session. 
 
OL 8 uses ""/etc/ssh/sshd_config"" for configurations of OpenSSH. Within the ""sshd_config"", the product of the values of ""ClientAliveInterval"" and ""ClientAliveCountMax"" are used to establish the inactivity threshold. The ""ClientAliveInterval"" is a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has been received from the client, sshd will send a message through the encrypted channel to request a response from the client. The ""ClientAliveCountMax"" is the number of client alive messages that may be sent without sshd receiving any messages back from the client. If this threshold is met, sshd will disconnect the client. For more information on these settings and others, refer to the sshd_config man pages.

Ownership is usually acquired as a consequence of creating the object or via specified ownership assignment. DAC allows the owner to determine who will have access to objects they control. An example of DAC includes user-controlled file permissions.

When DAC policies are implemented, subjects are not constrained as to what actions they can take with information for which they have already been granted access. Thus, subjects that have been granted access to information are not prevented from passing (i.e., the subjects have the discretion to pass) the information to other subjects or objects. A subject that is constrained in its operation by Mandatory Access Control (MAC) policies is still able to operate under the less rigorous constraints of this requirement. Therefore, while MAC imposes constraints preventing a subject from passing information to another subject operating at a different sensitivity level, this requirement permits the subject to pass the information to any subject at the same sensitivity level. The policy is bounded by the information system boundary. Once the information is passed outside the control of the information system, additional means may be required to ensure the constraints remain in effect. While the older, more traditional definitions of DAC require identity-based access control, that limitation is not required for this use of DAC.

By enabling the ""fs.protected_hardlinks"" kernel parameter, users can no longer create soft or hard links to files they do not own. Disallowing such hardlinks mitigate vulnerabilities based on insecure file system accessed by privileged programs, avoiding an exploitation vector exploiting unsafe use of open() or creat().

Determine to which partition the audit records are being written with the following command: 
 
$ sudo grep -iw log_file /etc/audit/auditd.conf 
log_file = /var/log/audit/audit.log 
 
Check the size of the partition to which audit records are written (with the example being ""/var/log/audit/"") with the following command: 
 
$ sudo df -h /var/log/audit/ 
/dev/sda2 24G 10.4G 13.6G 43% /var/log/audit 
 
If the audit records are not written to a partition made specifically for audit records (""/var/log/audit"" is a separate partition), determine the amount of space being used by other files in the partition with the following command: 
 
$ sudo du -sh [audit_partition] 
1.8G /var/log/audit 
 
If the audit record partition is not allocated for sufficient storage capacity, this is a finding. 
 
Note: The partition size needed to capture a week of audit records is based on the activity level of the system and the total storage capacity available.
