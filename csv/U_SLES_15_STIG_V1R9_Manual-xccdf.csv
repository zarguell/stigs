Every persistent disk partition present on the system must have an entry in the file. 

If any partitions other than pseudo file systems (such as /proc or /sys) are not listed or ""/etc/crypttab"" does not exist, this is a finding.","Configure the SUSE operating system to prevent unauthorized modification of all information at rest by using disk encryption. 

Encrypting a partition in an already-installed system is more difficult because of the need to resize and change existing partitions. To encrypt an entire partition, dedicate a partition for encryption in the partition layout. The standard partitioning proposal as suggested by YaST (installation and configuration tool for Linux) does not include an encrypted partition by default. Add it manually in the partitioning dialog.

Refer to the document ""SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP1 - Security Guide"", Section 12.1.2, for a detailed disk encryption guide:
