Un-validated cryptography is viewed by NIST as providing no protection to the information or data - in effect the data would be considered unprotected plaintext. If the agency specifies that the information or data be cryptographically protected, then FIPS 140-2 is applicable. In essence, if cryptography is required, then it must be validated. Cryptographic modules that have been approved for classified use may be used in lieu of modules that have been validated against the FIPS 140-2 standard. 

The cryptographic module used must have at least one validated digital signature function. This validated hash algorithm must be used to generate digital signatures for all cryptographic security function within the product being evaluated.
