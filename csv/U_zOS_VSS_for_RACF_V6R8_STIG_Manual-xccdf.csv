The installing System Programmer will identify and document the product data sets and categorize them according to who will have update and alter access and if required that all update and allocate access is logged. He will identify if any additional groups have update access for specific data sets, and once documented he will work with the IAO to see that they are properly restricted to the ACP (Access Control Program ) active on the system.

Verify that the accesses to resources and/or generic equivalent are properly restricted according to the requirements specified in Vanguard Security Solutions Resources table in the z/OS STIG Addendum. If the following guidance is true, this is not a finding.

___ The RACF resources are defined with a default access of NONE.

___ The RACF resource access authorizations restrict access to the appropriate personnel.

___ The RACF resource logging requirements are specified.

___ The RACF resource access authorizations are defined with UACC(NONE) and NOWARNING.

___ The RACF resource VSR$.SCOPE allowed READ access when approved and documented by ISSM  or equivalent Security Authority.","Configure ACP resource definitions in accordance with Vanguard Security Solutions Resources and Vanguard Security Solutions Resources Descriptions tables in the zOS STIG Addendum.
