Due to the unique file structure of the TMC and Audit data sets, CA 1 uses the YSVC programs to handle all direct I/O activity. Because standard OPEN/CLOSE macros are not used, typical data set security checks are not performed. Even if a user does not have read authority to these data sets, the YSVC programs can enable that user to read and update records within these files. Therefore, control READ access to the TMC and Audit data sets by the YSVCUNCD and YSVCCOND resource names. Typical users should be restricted to conditional READ access.

Restrict CA 1 batch production jobs, and CA 1 started tasks to the following access authority: Unconditional READ and UPDATE access to the TMC, Audit, Retention, and Vault Pattern Description data sets. NOTE: READ and UPDATE access to the TMC and Audit data sets are controlled by the YSVCUNCD and YSVCCOND resource names, and by standard ACP data set controls, because some CA 1 utilities use conventional OPEN/CLOSE methods.

CA 1 Online User Passwords can be obtained from TMSSECAB for all releases or TMOSECxx, if present, for r12.6 and above.","Ensure that the CA 1 function and password resource access is in accordance with those outlined in CA 1 Function and Password Resources table in the zOS STIG Addendum.

Use CA 1 Function and Password Resources and CA 1 Function and Password Resources for ACF2 tables in the zOS STIG Addendum. These tables list the resources, access requirements, and the resource type for CA 1 Function and Password Resources; ensure the following guidelines are followed:

The ACF2 resources and/or generic equivalent as designated in the above table are defined with a default access of NONE.

The ACF2 resource access authorizations restrict access to the appropriate personnel as designated in the above table.

The ACF2 resource logging is specified as designated in the above table.

The following commands are provided as a sample for implementing resource controls:

CA 1 external security utilizing ACF2 is accomplished in the manner described in this section.

NOTE:       The TMOOPTxx member is specified in the TMOSYSxx member in the data set allocated by the TMSPARM DD statement in the TMSINIT STC. By default, the suffix 00 is used for these members. However, overrides can be specified by PARM value(s) on the EXEC statement in the TMSINIT STC and/or in the TMOSYSxx member.

Review the options and values of the below CA 1 parameters. If the options are set to the specified value, this is not a finding.

CA 1 SECURITY OPTIONS - ACF2
Option       Value
BATCH       YES obsolete as of r12.0
CATSEC       NO obsolete as of r12.0
CMD       YES
CREATE      see Note 1
DSNB       YES
FUNC       YES see Note 2
OCEOV       NO see Note 3

PSWD       YES
SCRTCH       NO
SECWTO       YES
UNDEF       FAIL
UX0AUPD       NO see Note 4
YSVC       YES

Note 1       The CREATE parameter defines the level of access that is required to create a data set on tape. The default value is UPDATE. However, the vendor recommends the value be set to CREATE if you are running CA Top Secret or ACF2 and ALTER if you are running RACF.

Note 2       The FUNC option provides supplementary security for BLP access. The tape label bypass privilege must still be specified in the ACF2 user LID record to allow access to BLP processing.

Note 3       The CA 1 security option, OCEOV, is set to NO because ACF2 obtains control of data set OPEN/CLOSE processing before the CA 1 intercept. The vendor recommends that the first security call be used and that this CA 1 control option be turned OFF. Therefore, TAPEDSN must be specified in the OPTS option in the ACF2 GSO record.

Note 4       The UX0AUPD will specify YES only if you alter the fields in the TMC and the TMSUXxA (for r11.5 and below) or TMSXITA (for r12.0 and above) is changed.","The systems programmer/IAO will ensure that the CA 1 external security options are specified in accordance with the ACP being used.  CA 1 Tape Management ACP security interfaces are controlled by options coded in the TMOOPTxx member identified in the TMOSYSxx member of the data set allocated by the TMSPARM DD statement in the TMSINIT STC.  The specific required option settings are dependent on the ACP in use on the system.
