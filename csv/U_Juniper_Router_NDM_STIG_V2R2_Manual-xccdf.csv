Step 1: Verify that an input filter has been configured for the loopback interfaces as shown in the example below.

    …

    }
    lo0 {
        unit 0 {

            }
         }

Step 2: Verify that the filter restricts management traffic. The configuration example below restricts management access to specific IP addresses via SSH.

        from {
            source-address {

        then {
            log;
            discard;
        }
    }
} 

Note: Management and control plane traffic destined to the router is punted to the routing engine. Hence, applying the filter to the loopback ensures that this traffic can be monitored regardless of the ingress physical interface. 

If the Juniper router is not configured to enforce approved authorizations for controlling the flow of management information within the device based on control policies, this is a finding.","Step 1: Configure the router to restrict management access to specific IP addresses via SSH as shown in the example below.

The default maximum size depends on the platform type. By default, the logging utility creates up to 10 archive files in this manner.
