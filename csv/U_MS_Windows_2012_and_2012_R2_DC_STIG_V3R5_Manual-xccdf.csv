Configuration of whitelisting applications will vary by the program.

AppLocker is a whitelisting application built into Windows Server 2012.  A deny-by-default implementation is initiated by enabling any AppLocker rules within a category, only allowing what is specified by defined rules.

If AppLocker is used, perform the following to view the configuration of AppLocker:
Open PowerShell.

If the AppLocker PowerShell module has not been previously imported, execute the following first:
Import-Module AppLocker

Execute the following command, substituting [c:\temp\file.xml] with a location and file name appropriate for the system:
Get-AppLockerPolicy -Effective -XML > c:\temp\file.xml

This will produce an xml file with the effective settings that can be viewed in a browser or opened in a program such as Excel for review.
