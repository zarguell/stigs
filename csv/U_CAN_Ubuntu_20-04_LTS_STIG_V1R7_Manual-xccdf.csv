Without the capability to generate audit records, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one. 
 
Audit record content that may be necessary to satisfy this requirement includes, for example, time stamps, source and destination addresses, user/process identifiers, event descriptions, success/fail indications, filenames involved, and access control or flow control rules invoked. 
 
Reconstruction of harmful events or forensic analysis is not possible if audit records do not contain enough information. 
 
Successful incident response and auditing relies on timely, accurate system information and analysis in order to allow the organization to identify and respond to potential incidents in a proficient manner. If the operating system does not provide the ability to centrally review the operating system logs, forensic analysis is negatively impacted. 
 
Associating event types with detected events in the Ubuntu operating system audit logs provides a means of investigating an attack; recognizing resource utilization or capacity thresholds; or identifying an improperly configured operating system.

The task of allocating audit record storage capacity is usually performed during initial installation of the operating system.","","","false","","","","","","","","Verify the Ubuntu operating system allocates audit record storage capacity to store at least one week's worth of audit records when audit records are not immediately sent to a central audit record storage facility. 
 
Determine which partition the audit records are being written to with the following command: 
 
$ sudo grep ^log_file /etc/audit/auditd.conf 
log_file = /var/log/audit/audit.log 
 
Check the size of the partition that audit records are written to (with the example being ""/var/log/audit/"") with the following command: 
 
$ sudo df –h /var/log/audit/ 
/dev/sda2 24G 10.4G 13.6G 43% /var/log/audit 
 
If the audit records are not written to a partition made specifically for audit records (""/var/log/audit"" is a separate partition), determine the amount of space being used by other files in the partition with the following command: 
 
$ sudo du –sh [audit_partition] 
1.8G /var/log/audit 
 
Note: The partition size needed to capture a week's worth of audit records is based on the activity level of the system and the total storage capacity available. In normal circumstances, 10.0 GB of storage space for audit records will be sufficient.
