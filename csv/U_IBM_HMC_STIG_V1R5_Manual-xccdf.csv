The RSF, which is also commonly referred to as call home, is one of the key components that contributes to zero downtime on System z hardware.

The Hardware Management Console RSF provides communication to an IBM support network, known as RETAIN for hardware problem reporting and service.
When a Hardware Management Console enables RSF, the Hardware Management Console then becomes a call home server. 
The types of communication that are provided are:

- Problem reporting and repair data.
- Fix delivery to the service processor and Hardware Management Console.
- Hardware inventory data.
- System updates that are required to activate Capacity on Demand changes.

The following call home security characteristics are in effect regardless of the connectivity method that is chosen:
RSF requests are always initiated from the Hardware Management Console to IBM. An inbound connection is never initiated from the IBM Service Support System.
All data that is transferred between the Hardware Management Console and the IBM Service Support System is encrypted in a high-grade Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption.
When initializing the SSL-encrypted connection, the Hardware Management Console validates the trusted host by its digital signature issued for the IBM Service Support system.
