/opt/grizzly/www/webapp/resources/

3. Open the ""customBranding.json"" file from the following location:

4. In the customBranding.json file, do the following:
a. To modify the images, specify the names of the custom files added to the custom-images folder. The logon page image recommended size is 1574x1920.
b. To modify the welcome message, replace ""customWelcomeTitle"" and ""customWelcomeSubtitle"" with the desired text.

5. Perform a hard reload of the HYCU Web UI page in the web browser.

The console and ssh logon can be configured to display the DoD banner by modifying ""/etc/issue.net"" with the required text and editing the ""/etc/ssh/sshd_config"" file to uncomment the banner keyword and configure it to point to ""/etc/issue"" as shown below:

Unique session IDs address man-in-the-middle attacks, including session hijacking or insertion of false information into a session. If the attacker is unable to identify or guess the session information related to pending application traffic, they will have more difficulty in hijacking the session or otherwise manipulating valid sessions.

Within the ""Events"" menu, click on the email notifications button and configure the items to be sent in an email notification. Ensure the correct email address is used for the individual(s) who will need to receive the notifications. 

To ship/send logs from the HYCU VM to a central logging server (e.g., Splunk, SolarWinds), engage with the log server vendor and HYCU Support. In the absence of another third-party solution, consider setting up a Rsyslog Server and make HYCU a client. 

To configure an Rsyslog client:

# send logs to remote host, too

[root@hycuserver ~]#  vi /etc/rsyslog.conf
# add to the end
