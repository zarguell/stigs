Failing to disconnect from collaborative computing devices (i.e. cameras) can result in subsequent compromises of organizational information. Providing easy methods to physically disconnect from such devices after a collaborative computing session helps to ensure that participants actually carry out the disconnect activity without having to go through complex and tedious procedures.

Satisfies: SRG-OS-000095-GPOS-00049, SRG-OS-000370-GPOS-00155","","","false","","","","","","","","If the device or operating system does not have a camera installed, this requirement is not applicable.

This requirement is not applicable to mobile devices (smartphones and tablets), where the use of the camera is a local AO decision.

This requirement is not applicable to dedicated VTC suites located in approved VTC locations that are centrally managed.

For an external camera, if there is not a method for the operator to manually disconnect camera at the end of collaborative computing sessions, this is a finding.

For a built-in camera, the camera must be protected by a camera cover (e.g. laptop camera cover slide) when not in use. If the built-in camera is not protected with a camera cover, or if the built-in
camera is not disabled in the bios, this is a finding.

If the camera is not disconnected or covered, the following registry entry is required:

If ""Value Name"" is set to a value other than ""Deny"" and the collaborative computing device has not been authorized for use, this is a finding.","If the camera is not disconnected or covered, the following registry entry is required.

1) Something a user knows (e.g., password/PIN);

2) Something a user has (e.g., cryptographic identification device, token); and

3) Something a user is (e.g., biometric).

Network access is defined as access to an information system by a user (or a process acting on behalf of a user) communicating through a network (e.g., local area network, wide area network, or the Internet).

Local access is defined as access to an organizational information system by a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) communicating through a direct connection without the use of a network.
