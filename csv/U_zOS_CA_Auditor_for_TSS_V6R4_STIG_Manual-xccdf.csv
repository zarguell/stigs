Verify that the accesses to the CA Auditor installation data sets are properly restricted.
 
___ The TSS data set rules for the data sets restricts READ access to auditors, security administrators, and/or CA Auditor's STCs and batch users.

___ The TSS data set rules for the data sets restricts UPDATE and/or ALL access to systems programming personnel.

___ The TSS data set rules for the data sets specify that all (i.e., failures and successes) UPDATE and/or ALL access are logged.","The ISSO will ensure that update and allocate access to CA Auditor installation data sets is limited to systems programmers only, and all update and allocate access is logged. Read access can be given to auditors, security administrators, and/or CA Auditor's STCs and batch users.

The installing systems programmer will identify and document the product data sets and categorize them according to who will have update and alter access and if required that all update and allocate access is logged. The installing systems programmer will identify if any additional groups have update and/or alter access for specific data sets, and once documented will work with the ISSO to ensure they are properly restricted to the ACP (Access Control Program) active on the system.
