Verify that access to the IBM Communications Server Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (CSSMTP) STC data sets are properly restricted. The data sets to be protected are identified in the data set referenced in the DD statements of the CSSMTP started task(s) and/or batch job(s).

Refer to the following report produced by the Data Set and Resource Data Collection:

- SENSITVE.RPT(SMTPSTC)

Automated Analysis:
Refer to the following report produced by the Data Set and Resource Data Collection:

- PDI(ZSMT0001)

If the following guidance is true, this is not a finding.

___ The ACF2 data set access authorizations restrict READ access to auditors.

___ The ACF2 data set access authorizations restrict WRITE and/or greater access to systems programming personnel.

___ The ACF2 data set access authorizations restrict WRITE and/or greater access to the product STC(s) and/or batch job(s).","Ensure that WRITE and/or greater access to the IBM Communications Server Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (CSSMTP) STC data sets are limited to system programmers and CSSMTP STC and/or batch jobs only. READ access can be given to auditors at the ISSOs discretion.

The installing systems programmer will identify and document the product data sets and categorize them according to who will have what type of access and if required which type of access is logged. The installing systems programmer will identify any additional groups requiring access to specific data sets, and once documented will work with the ISSO to ensure they are properly restricted to the ACP (Access Control Program) active on the system.

Note: The data sets and/or data set prefixes identified below are examples of a possible installation. The actual data sets and/or prefixes are determined when the product is actually installed on a system through the product's installation guide and can be site specific. 

The following commands are provided as an example for implementing data set controls:

If the product requires a Started Task, verify that it is properly defined to the System ACP with the proper attributes.

Most installation manuals will indicate how the Started Task is identified and any additional attributes that must be specified.
