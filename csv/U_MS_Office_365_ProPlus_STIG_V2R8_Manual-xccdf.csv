If you enable this policy setting, you can choose from four options for determining how the specified applications will warn the user about macros:

- Disable all with notification: The application displays the Trust Bar for all macros, whether signed or unsigned. This option enforces the default configuration in Office.
- Disable all except digitally signed macros: The application displays the Trust Bar for digitally signed macros, allowing users to enable them or leave them disabled. Any unsigned macros are disabled, and users are not notified.
- Disable all without notification: The application disables all macros, whether signed or unsigned, and does not notify users.
- Enable all macros (not recommended): All macros are enabled, whether signed or unsigned. This option can significantly reduce security by allowing dangerous code to run undetected.

If you disable this policy setting, ""Disable all with notification"" will be the default setting.

If you do not configure this policy setting, when users open files in the specified applications that contain VBA macros, the applications open the files with the macros disabled and display the Trust Bar with a warning that macros are present and have been disabled. Users can inspect and edit the files if appropriate, but cannot use any disabled functionality until they enable it by clicking ""Enable Content"" on the Trust Bar.

Important: If ""Disable all except digitally signed macros"" is selected, users will not be able to open unsigned Access databases.

Also, note that Microsoft Office stores certificates for trusted publishers in the Internet Explorer trusted publisher store. Earlier versions of Microsoft Office stored trusted publisher certificate information (specifically, the certificate thumbprint) in a special Office trusted publisher store. Microsoft Office still reads trusted publisher certificate information from the Office trusted publisher store, but it does not write information to this store.

ActiveX controls can adversely affect a computer directly. In addition, malicious code can be used to compromise an ActiveX control and attack a computer. 

To indicate the safety of an ActiveX control, developers can denote them as Safe for Initialization (SFI). SFI indicates that a control is safe to open and run, and that it is not capable of causing a problem for any computer, regardless of whether it has persisted data values or not. If a control is not marked SFI, it is possible that the control could adversely affect a computer--or it could mean that the developers did not test the control in all situations and are not sure whether it might be compromised in the future. If you enable this policy setting, you can set the ActiveX security level to a number between 1 and 6. These security levels are as follows:
 
1. Regardless of how the control is marked, load it and use the persisted values (if any). This setting does not prompt the user.

3. If SFI, load the control in unsafe mode and use persisted values (if any). If not SFI, prompt the user and advise them that it is marked unsafe. If the user chooses No at the prompt, do not load the control. Otherwise, load it with default (first-time initialization) settings.

ActiveX controls can adversely affect a computer directly. In addition, malicious code can be used to compromise an ActiveX control and attack a computer. 

To indicate the safety of an ActiveX control, developers can denote them as Safe for Initialization (SFI). SFI indicates that a control is safe to open and run, and that it is not capable of causing a problem for any computer, regardless of whether it has persisted data values or not. If a control is not marked SFI, it is possible that the control could adversely affect a computer--or it could mean that the developers did not test the control in all situations and are not sure whether it might be compromised in the future. If you enable this policy setting, you can set the ActiveX security level to a number between 1 and 6. These security levels are as follows:
 
1. Regardless of how the control is marked, load it and use the persisted values (if any). This setting does not prompt the user. 

2. If SFI, load the control in safe mode and use persisted values (if any). If not SFI, load in unsafe mode with persisted values (if any), or use the default (first-time initialization) settings. This level is similar to the default configuration, but does not prompt the user.

ActiveX controls are Component Object Model (COM) objects and have unrestricted access to users' computers. ActiveX controls can access the local file system and change the registry settings of the operating system. If a malicious user repurposes an ActiveX control to take over a user's computer, the effect could be significant. To help improve security, ActiveX developers can mark controls as SFI, which means that the developer states that the controls are safe to open and run and not capable of causing harm to any computers. If a control is not marked SFI, the control could adversely affect a computer, or the developers may not have tested the control in all situations and are not sure whether their control might be compromised at some future date. SFI controls run in safe mode, which limits their access to the computer. For example, a worksheet control can both read and write files when it is in unsafe mode, but perhaps only read from files when it is in safe mode. This functionality allows the control to be used in very powerful ways when safety was not important, but the control would still be safe for use in a Web page. If a control is not marked as SFI, it is marked UFI, which means that it is capable of affecting a user's computer. If UFI ActiveX controls are loaded, they are always loaded in unsafe mode.

2. Users are prompted to determine how UserForm forms will load. The prompt only displays once per session within an application. When users respond to the prompt, loading continues based on whether the control is UFI or SFI: 
 
- For a UFI signed control, if users respond ""Yes"" to the prompt, load the control in unsafe mode. If users respond ""No"", load the control using the default properties. 
- For an SFI signed control that supports both safe and unsafe modes, if users respond ""Yes"" to the prompt, load the control in unsafe mode. If users respond ""No"", load the control using safe mode. If the SFI control can only support safe mode, load the control in safe mode. This option is the default configuration in the Microsoft Office 365 ProPlus release.

If you enable this policy setting, you can choose from four options for handling macros in Outlook: 
- Always warn. This option corresponds to the ""Warnings for all macros"" option in the ""Macro Security"" section of the Outlook Trust Center. Outlook disables all macros that are not opened from a trusted location, even if the macros are signed by a trusted publisher. For each disabled macro, Outlook displays a security alert dialog box with information about the macro and its digital signature (if present), and allows users to enable the macro or leave it disabled. 
- Never warn, disable all. This option corresponds to the ""No warnings and disable all macros"" option in the Trust Center. Outlook disables all macros that are not opened from trusted locations, and does not notify users. 
- Warning for signed, disable unsigned. This option corresponds to the ""Warnings for signed macros; all unsigned macros are disabled"" option in the Trust Center. Outlook handles macros as follows: 
--If a macro is digitally signed by a trusted publisher, the macro can run if the user has already trusted the publisher. 
--If a macro has a valid signature from a publisher that the user has not trusted, the security alert dialog box for the macro lets the user choose whether to enable the macro for the current session, disable the macro for the current session, or to add the publisher to the Trusted Publishers list so that it will run without prompting the user in the future. 
--If a macro does not have a valid signature, Outlook disables it without prompting the user, unless it is opened from a trusted location. 
This option is the default configuration in Outlook. 
- No security check. This option corresponds to the ""No security check for macros (Not recommended)"" option in the Trust Center. Outlook runs all macros without prompting users. This configuration makes users' computers vulnerable to potentially malicious code and is not recommended.

If you do not configure this policy setting, when users open files in the specified applications that contain VBA macros, the applications open the files with the macros disabled and display the Trust Bar with a warning that macros are present and have been disabled.

If you enable this policy setting, users can specify trusted locations on network shares or in other remote locations that are not under their direct control by clicking the ""Add new location"" button in the Trusted Locations section of the Trust Center. Content, code, and add-ins are allowed to load from trusted locations with minimal security and without prompting the user for permission.

If you disable this policy setting, the selected application ignores any network locations listed in the Trusted Locations section of the Trust Center. 

If you also deploy Trusted Locations via Group Policy, you should verify whether any of them are remote locations. If any of them are remote locations and you do not allow remote locations via this policy setting, those policy keys that point to remote locations will be ignored on client computers.

Disabling this policy setting does not delete any network locations from the Trusted Locations list, but causes disruption for users who add network locations to the Trusted Locations list. Users are also prevented from adding new network locations to the Trusted Locations list in the Trust Center.
