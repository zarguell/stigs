Swarm Mode is built in to Docker Engine - Enterprise and uses TLS 1.2 at a minimum for encrypting communications. Under the hood, Swarm Mode includes an embedded public key infrastructure (PKI) system. When a UCP cluster is initialized, the first node in the cluster designates itself as a manager node. That node subsequently generates a new root Certificate Authority (CA) along with a key pair, which are used to secure communications with other UCP nodes that join the swarm. One can also specify his/her own externally-generated root CA upon initialization of a UCP cluster. The manager node also generates two tokens to use when joining additional nodes to the cluster: one worker token and one manager token. Each token includes the digest of the root CAâ€™s certificate and a randomly generated secret. When a node joins the cluster, the joining node uses the digest to validate the root CA certificate from the remote manager. The remote manager uses the secret to ensure the joining node is an approved node. Each time a new node joins the cluster, the manager issues a certificate to the node. The certificate contains a randomly generated node ID to identify the node under the certificate common name (CN) and the role under the organizational unit (OU). The node ID serves as the cryptographically secure node identity for the lifetime of the node in the current swarm. In this mutual TLS architecture, all nodes encrypt communications using a minimum of TLS 1.2, thereby satisfying the requirements of this control. This information can also be referenced at https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/how-swarm-mode-works/pki/ and https://docs.docker.com/ee/ucp/ucp-architecture/.

By itself, Docker Engine - Enterprise is configured by default to listen for API requests via a UNIX domain socket (or IPC socket) created at /var/run/docker.sock on supported Linux distributions and via a named pipe at npipe:////./pipe/docker_engine on Windows Server 2016 and newer. Docker Engine - Enterprise can also be configured to listen for API requests via additional socket types, including both TCP and FD (only on supported systemd-based Linux distributions). If configured to listen for API requests via the TCP socket type over TCP port 2376 and with the daemon flags and SSL certificates, then, at a minimum, TLS 1.2 is used for encryption; therefore this control is applicable and is inherently met in this configuration. If configured to listen for API requests via the TCP socket type, but without TLS verification and certifications, then the instance remains vulnerable and is not properly configured to meet the requirements of this control. If configured to listen for API requests via the FD socket type, then this control is not applicable. More information can be found at https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/dockerd/#daemon-socket-option.

 - method and API endpoint for the request
 - UCP user which made the request
 - response status (success/failure)

Manage the CPU shares between containers. To do so, start the container using the --cpu-shares argument.

For example, run a container as below:

docker run --interactive --tty --cpu-shares 512 [image] [command]

In the above example, the container is started with CPU shares of 50% of what the other containers use. So, if the other container has CPU shares of 80%, this container will have CPU shares of 40%.

Note: Every new container will have 1024 shares of CPU by default. However, this value is shown as 0 if running the command mentioned in the audit section.

Alternatively,

1. Navigate to /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/system.slice/ directory.
2. Check the container instance ID using docker ps.
3. Now, inside the above directory (in step 1), there will be a directory by name docker-<Instance ID>.scope. For example, docker-4acae729e8659c6be696ee35b2237cc1fe4edd2672e9186434c5116e1a6fbed6.scope. Navigate to this directory.
4. Find a file named cpu.shares. Execute cat cpu.shares. This will always show the CPU share value based on the system. So, even if there is no CPU shares configured using -c or --cpu-shares argument in the docker run command, this file will have a value of 1024.

By setting one containerâ€™s CPU shares to 512, it will receive half of the CPU time compared to the other container. So, take 1024 as 100% and then do quick math to derive the number that set for respective CPU shares. For example, use 512 to set 50% and 256 to set 25%.","SV-104787,V-95649,CCI-000381"

Enabling the --read-only option at a container's runtime should be used by administrators to force a container's executable processes to only write container data to explicit storage locations during the container's runtime.

Examples of explicit storage locations during a container's runtime include, but are not limited to:

1. Use the --tmpfs option to mount a temporary file system for non-persistent data writes.

Example:
docker run --interactive --tty --read-only --tmpfs ""/run"" --tmpfs ""/tmp"" [image] [command]

2. Enabling Docker rw mounts at a container's runtime to persist container data directly on the Docker host filesystem.

Example:
docker run --interactive --tty --read-only -v /opt/app/data:/run/app/data:rw [image] [command]

3. Utilizing Docker shared-storage volume plugins for Docker data volume to persist container data.

The UCP component of Docker Enterprise includes a built-in public key infrastructure (PKI) system. When a UCP cluster is initialized, the first node designates itself as a manager node. That node subsequently generates a new root CA along with a key pair, which are used to secure communications with other UCP manager and worker nodes that are joined to the cluster.

The manager node also generates two tokens to use when joining additional nodes to the cluster: one worker token and one manager token. Each token includes the digest of the root CAâ€™s certificate and a randomly generated secret. When a node joins the cluster, the joining node uses the digest to validate the root CA certificate from the remote manager. The remote manager uses the secret to ensure the joining node is an approved node. Each time a new node joins the cluster, the manager issues a certificate to the node.
