Specifically, DoD Instruction 8010.01, DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE INFORMATION NETWORK (DODIN) TRANSPORT, Sept 10, 2018 states:
Para 4.4 “a. Commercial transport services procured as an alternative to the DISN-provided transport requires compliance with this issuance or DoD CIO review and approval.”

Based on the use cases below, verify written approval has been obtained from the Office of the DoD CIO or verify a renewal request has been appropriately submitted. There are three basic use cases for an ISP connection.  

Use case (1): An ISP connection that originates from an approved DISN infrastructure source (includes IAP connections at the DECCs). A DoDIN Waiver is required for a CC/S/A to connect the unclassified DISN to an ISP. These connection requests must come to the Waiver Panel with a Component CIO endorsement of the requirement. These connections should not be provisioned and put into use until waived. Expired waivers pending renewal from the OSD DoDIN Waiver Panel may be downgraded to a Severity 3 category, if proof of a requested renewal can be verified. A DISN enclave that cannot prove DoDIN Waiver approval for the ISP connection is a Severity 1 category. Note: If discovered during a CCRI assessment, the review team lead will immediately report the unapproved ISP connection to the USCYBERCOM (301-688-3585) and the Connection Approval Office (301-225-2900/2901). USCYBERCOM will direct the connection be immediately disconnected. 

Use Case (2): An ISP connection to a Stand Alone Enclave (physically and logically separated from any DISN connection) requires DoDIN Waiver approval prior to connection. The Stand Alone Enclave must have an AO issued ATO and the connection must be logically and physically separated from the DISN. An unapproved ISP connection in this use case will be assigned a Severity 3 category.

Use Case (3): An ISP connection to a non-DoD network (such as a contractor-owned infrastructure) co-located on the same premises as the DoD network. The non-DoD network is physically and logically separated from any DoD IP network. Furthermore, it is not connected to any DoD IP network. The non-DoD network infrastructure is not DoD funded nor is it operated or administered by DoD military or civilian personnel. In addition, the non-DoD network with the ISP connection is not storing, processing, or transmitting any DoD data. For such a network as defined herein, a DoDIN Waiver approval is not required for deploying a connection to an ISP. However, the AO must perform and have on file a risk assessment endorsed by the facility or installation command.

If any of the above use cases are applicable, and written approval has been not been obtained from the Office of the DoD CIO or a renewal request has not been submitted, this is a finding.","Written mission justification approval must be obtained from the Office of the DoD CIO prior to establishing a direct connection to the Internet via commercial service provider outside DoD CIO approved Internet access points (e.g. DISA IAP, Cloud Access Point, NIPRnet Federated Gateway, DREN IAP, etc.).","V-8051,SV-8537,CCI-001101,CCI-001121"

Software updates fix bugs in the IDPS software or add new functionality, while signature updates add new detection capabilities or refine existing detection capabilities (e.g., reducing false positives). For many IDPSs, signature updates cause program code to be altered or replaced, so they are really a specialized form of software update. For other IDPSs, signatures are not written in code, so a signature update is a change to the configuration data for the IDPS. 

Software updates can include any or all IDPS components, including sensors, agents, management servers, and consoles. Software updates for sensors and management servers, particularly appliance-based devices, are often applied by replacing an existing IDPS CD with a new one and rebooting the device. Many IDPSs run the software directly from the CD, so that no software installation is required. Other components, such as agents, require an administrator to install software or apply patches, either manually on each host or automatically through IDPS management software. Some vendors make software and signature updates available for download from their Web sites or other servers; often, the administrator interfaces for IDPSs have features for downloading and installing such updates. 

Administrators should verify the integrity of updates before applying them, because updates could have been inadvertently or intentionally altered or replaced. The recommended verification method depends on the update's format, as follows:

Files downloaded from a Web site or FTP site. Administrators should compare file checksums provided by the vendor with checksums that they compute for the downloaded files. 

Update downloaded automatically through the IDPS user interface. If an update is downloaded as a single file or a set of files, either checksums provided by the vendor should be compared to checksums generated by the administrator, or the IDPS user interface itself should perform some sort of integrity check. In some cases, updates might be downloaded and installed as one action, precluding checksum verification; the IDPS user interface should check each update's integrity as part of this. 

Removable media (e.g., CD, DVD). Vendors may not provide a specific method for customers to verify the legitimacy of removable media apparently sent by the vendors. If media verification is a concern, administrators should contact their vendors to determine how the media can be verified, such as comparing vendor-provided checksums to checksums computed for files on the media, or verifying digital signatures on the media's contents to ensure they are valid. Administrators should also consider scanning the media for malware, with the caveat that false positives might be triggered by IDPS signatures for malware on the media.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>","There are two types of IDPS updates: software updates and signature updates.

If authentication is not being used for these protocols using a secured hashing algorithm for message authentication, this is a finding.

An LDP session is secured by configuring a password for each LDP peer as shown in the example below:

mpls ip
mpls label protocol ldp
mpls ldp neighbor 10.1.1.1 password xzxxxxxxxxxxx 
mpls ldp neighbor 10.3.3.3 password xxxxxzzzzxxxz

The IP address 10.1.1.1 and 10.3.3.3 in this example are the router IDs of the neighbors for which this router has an LDP session requiring MD5 authentication. To specify that the router ID 10.1.1.1 is to be found in VPN routing/forwarding instance (VRF) named VPN1 instead of the global route table, the ""vrf"" keyword is used in the command as shown in the following example:

mpls ldp neighbor vrf VPN1 10.1.1.1 password xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

A group of peers using the same MD5 password can be configured as shown in the example below: 

mpls ldp password for 10 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
mpls ldp password required for 10
!
access-list 10 permit 10.1.1.1
access-list 10 permit 10.3.3.3
access-list 10 permit 10.4.4.4

The access list specifies a password is mandatory for LDP sessions with neighbors whose LDP router IDs are permitted by the access list.

To configure MD5 or SHA-1 authentication for RSVP, both ip rsvp authentication key and ip rsvp authentication commands must be configured as shown in the example below. The latter command simply enables authentication.

The recommended practice is to delay the preemption action until after the IGP has a chance to stabilize.","","","false","","","","","","","","All routers or multilayer switches providing first-hop redundancy services must be configured to delay preemption to provide enough time for the IGP to stabilize. Review the router or multilayer switch providing first-hop redundancy services and verify that the preemption delay is configured.

If preemption delay is not configured, this is a finding.

Following is an HSRP configuration example that delays the preemption by 30 seconds.

interface GigabitEthernet 0/0/0
ip address 10.11.0.2 255.255.255.0
standby 1 priority 110
standby 1 ip 10.21.0.1
standby 1 preempt
standby 1 preempt delay minimum 30

Following is a VRRP configuration example that delays the preemption by 30 seconds.

interface GigabitEthernet 0/0/0
ip address 10.11.0.2 255.255.255.0
vrrp 1 priority 110
vrrp 1 ip 10.21.0.1
vrrp 1 preempt delay minimum 30

For VRRP implementations, a preemptive scheme is enabled by default. If preemption is disabled using the no vrrp preempt command, the virtual router backup that is elected to become virtual router master remains the master until the original virtual router master recovers and becomes master again.","Configure each router and multilayer switch providing first-hop redundancy services to be configured to delay the preempt to provide enough time for the IGP to stabilize.

Note: The amount of delay will be based on the number of IGP routes.","V-66397,SV-80887,CCI-000366"
