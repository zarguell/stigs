Validation Procedure for Method #1: CRL Checking

On the management tool, in the Work profile certificate section, verify that ""Revocation check"" is set to ""enable for all apps"".

If on the management tool ""Revocation check"" is not set to ""enable for all apps"", this is a finding.

Validation Procedure for Method #2: OCSP with CRL Fallback

On the management tool:
1. In the Work profile certificate section, verify that ""Revocation check"" is set to ""enable for all apps"".
2. In the Work profile restrictions section, verify that ""OCSP check"" is set to ""enable for all apps"".
