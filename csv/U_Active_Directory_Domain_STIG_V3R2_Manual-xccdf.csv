It is highly recommended to use Microsoft's Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS), which provides an automated solution for maintaining and regularly changing a local administrator password for domain-joined systems. LAPS can manage a single local administrator account. The default is the built-in administrator account; however, it can be configured to manage an administrator account of a different name. If additional local administrator accounts exist across systems, the organization must have a process to require unique passwords on each system for the additional accounts.

The AO may approve other automated solutions that provide this capability.

If LAPS has been installed and enabled in the domain, the following PowerShell query will return a list of systems that do not have a local administrator password managed by LAPS. (The LAPS PowerShell module requires PowerShell 2.0 or higher and .NET Framework 4.0.)

Open ""Windows PowerShell"".
If the LAPS PowerShell module has not been previously imported, execute the following first: ""Import-Module AdmPwd.ps"".
Execute ""Get-AdmPwdPassword -ComputerName * | Where-object {$_.password -eq $null}""

Review the returned list for validity.

If any active/deployed Windows systems that are not managed by another process to ensure unique passwords for local administrator accounts are listed, this is a finding.
