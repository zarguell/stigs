  a. The strings in some fields—such as the local user attribute name (“userid”) and the last part of the service provider endpoint address (“.luna-sp.com”)—are pre-specified by Luna  Control Center. Using the information about your identity provider (IDP). Fill in the first three fields:
   - Service Provider End-point
   - Entity ID
   - Single Sign-On URL
  b. The next field, ""Single Logout URL"", is optional. If your SAML metadata includes this information and you wish to configure for a Single Logout, you may enter it here.
  c. Enter an email address that should receive notifications from Luna Control Center.
  d. Enter thex509c Certificate key.
  e. The next field, Alternate x509c Certificate Key, is optional. If you have an alternate x509c Certificate key, you may enter it here. Having a second key can be convenient if your current key is nearing expiration and your IDP supports key rotation.
  f. When the required information has been entered, click ""Save"" or click ""Save & Activate"".
   - Click Save if you want to keep a draft of your configuration without activating it yet. In the Manage Single Sign-On with SAML application’s main panel, “Inactive” then appears in the Status column of the new configuration. This means it has been saved but is not yet activated.
