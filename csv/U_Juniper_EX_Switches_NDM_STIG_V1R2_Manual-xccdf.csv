The lack of authorization-based access control could result in the immediate compromise and unauthorized access to sensitive information. All DoD systems must be properly configured to incorporate access control methods that do not rely solely on authentication for authorized access.

Authorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset or set of resources. Information systems use access control policies and enforcement mechanisms to implement this requirement. Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization.

Some network devices are pre-configured with security groups. Other network devices enable operators to create custom security groups with custom permissions. For example, an ISSM may require read-only access to audit the network device. Operators may create an audit security group, define permissions and access levels for members of the group, and then assign the ISSM’s user persona to the audit security group. This is still considered privileged access, but the ISSM’s security group is more restrictive than the network administrator’s security group.

Network devices that rely on AAA brokers for authentication and authorization services may need to identify the available security groups or access levels available on the network devices and convey that information to the AAA operator. Once the AAA broker identifies the user persona on the centralized directory service, the user’s security group memberships can be retrieved.

This requirement may be verified by demonstration or configuration review.

Juniper switches use role-based access controls (RBAC) to assign privilege levels. Account definitions in Junos are either ""local"" or ""template"", discriminated by the presence of an authentication stanza. Local accounts have an authentication stanza and support both external and/or  local authentication depending upon the authentication order. Template accounts do not have an authentication stanza and only support external authentication. Every account (local and template) must be assigned a login class by an authorized administrator.

Verify each account is assigned a login class with appropriate permissions based upon organizational requirements. Login classes support optional allow- and deny- directives as shown in the examples. Organizational requirements may require different allow- and deny- directives, or no directives at all.

Operational and configuration mode commands require assignment of the required permission bit to execute. For example, audit logs are configured in the [edit system] hierarchy and require the ""system"" permission to view and the ""system-control"" permission to configure (or permissions set ""all""). However, using the allow or deny statements permits adding, or removing, specific commands or configuration hierarchy levels. Adding the ""deny-commands ""^clear log"""" directive to a login class prevents any user assigned to that class from clearing any log file.

Verify the permissions assigned to each login class is appropriate.

In addition to limiting permissions, Junos supports limiting commands and hierarchy levels that would otherwise be permitted. For example, to remove the ability to modify auditing from a login class with the ""system-control"" or ""all"" permissions assigned, use the ""deny-configuration-regexps [ ""system syslog"" ]"" directive. To prevent administrative users assigned to that same login class from viewing and/or deleting the audit file contents, add the ""deny-commands ""^(show|clear) log"""" directive.

Juniper switches use role-based access controls (RBAC) to assign privilege levels. Account definitions in Junos are either ""local"" or ""template"", discriminated by the presence of an authentication stanza. Local accounts have an authentication stanza and support both external and local authentication. Template accounts do not have an authentication stanza and only support external authentication. Every account (local and template) must be assigned a login class by an authorized administrator. 

Installation of firmware requires the maintenance permission bit. However, even with that bit set, software installation can be limited by the ""deny-commands"" statement (e.g., deny-commands ""^request system software""). The command takes a regular expression (REGEX) enclosed in double quotes ("").

Verify each account is assigned a login class with appropriate permissions based upon organizational requirements. Login classes support optional allow- and deny- directives as shown in the examples. Organizational requirements may require different allow- and deny- directives or no directives at all.

Valid factors include something the individual knows (e.g., username and password), something the individual has (e.g., a smartcard or token), or something the individual is (e.g., a fingerprint or biometric). Legacy information system environments only use a single factor for authentication, typically a username and password combination. Although two pieces of data are used in a username and password combination, this is still considered single factor because an attacker can obtain access by learning what the user knows. 

Common attacks against single-factor authentication are attacks on user passwords. These attacks include brute force password guessing, password spraying, and password credential stuffing. MFA, along with strong user account hygiene, helps mitigate the threat of having account passwords discovered by an attacker. Even in the event of a password compromise, with MFA implemented and required for interactive login, the attacker still needs to acquire something the user has or replicate a piece of user’s biometric digital presence.

Private industry recognizes and uses a wide variety of MFA solutions. However, DoD public key infrastructure (PKI) is the only prescribed method approved for DoD organizations to implement MFA. This requirement is used in conjunction with the use of a centralized authentication server (e.g., AAA, RADIUS, LDAP), a separate but equally important requirement. The centralized authentication server will provide the second phase of authentication (the digital presence of the PKI ID as a valid user in the requested security domain) and authorization. 

Junos currently supports PAP and MS-CHAPv2 for administrative authentication. To mitigate this risk, sites must configure the authorized CAC alternative YubiKey One-Time Password (OTP). The OTP uses AES (AES256 is preferred by DoD) encrypted on the token prior to transmission and is valid only once. When using the authorized CAC alternative SecureID, the credential is valid for 60 seconds or first use, and is valid only once. The single local account (the account of last resort) password is securely hashed in Junos and never transmitted.

To support the authorized CAC alternatives, configure Junos for RADIUS and point to the appropriate authentication server.

Juniper network devices support monitoring the audit log storage partition (/var), monitoring the SNMP health status, or both. On devices supporting disk partition monitoring, verify the audit log partition (/var) free space is configured appropriately for the environment. For example, to generate ""high disk usage"" alerts at 80 percent capacity (20 percent free), and ""full disk usage"" at 90 percent capacity (10 percent free):
[edit chassis]
disk-partition /var {
    level full {
        free-space 10 percent;
    }
    level high {
        free-space 20 percent;
    }
}
Note: The configurable parameter is a percentage of free space remaining, not percentage used. ""High"" usage percent of remaining free space must be equal to, or greater than, the ""full"" usage percent of remaining free space.

For network devices supporting SNMP health monitoring, verify the rising and falling threshold values for monitored objects (e.g., CPU, memory, and disk storage usage). In the example below, any monitored object exceeding 75 percent usage will generate an alert. Another alert is generated when the usage falls below 74 percent. As configured in the example, Junos samples every 300 seconds. The falling threshold value must be less than the rising threshold value.

Juniper switches use role-based access controls (RBAC) to assign privilege levels.

Local accounts have an authentication stanza and support both external and local authentication. Template accounts do not have an authentication stanza and only support external authentication.

Installation of firmware requires the maintenance permission bit.

The command takes a regular expression (REGEX) enclosed in double quotes ("").

Verify each account is assigned a login class with appropriate permissions based upon organizational requirements. Login classes support optional allow- and deny- directives as shown in the examples.
