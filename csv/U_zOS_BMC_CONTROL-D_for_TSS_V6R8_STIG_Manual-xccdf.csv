-       TSSCMDS.RPT(FACLIST) - Preferred report containing all control option values in effect including default values
-       TSSCMDS.RPT(TSSPRMFL) - Alternate report containing only control option values explicitly coded at TSS startup

Ensure the BMC CONTROL-D Facility Matrix table is defined as follows:

FAC(USERxx=NAME=CONTROLD,PGM=CTD,ID=nn,ACTIVE,SHRPRF)
FAC(CONTROLD=ASUBM,NOABEND,MULTIUSER,NOXDEF,SIGN(S))
FAC(CONTROLD=RES,LUMSG,STMSG,WARNPW,NORNDPW)
FAC(CONTROLD=NOAUDIT,NOTSOC,MODE=FAIL)
FAC(CONTROLD=LOG(SMF,INIT,MSG,SEC9),UIDACID=8,LOCKTIME=000)","The BMC CONTROL-D system programmer and the IAO will ensure that the TOP SECRET Facility Matrix Table is proper defined using the following example:

CONTROLD:
FAC(USERxx=NAME=CONTROLD,PGM=CTO,ID=nn,ACTIVE,SHRPRF)
FAC(CONTROLD=ASUBM,NOABEND,MULTIUSER,NOXDEF)
FAC(CONTROLD=LUMSG,STMSG,SIGN(S),WARNPW,NORNDPW)
