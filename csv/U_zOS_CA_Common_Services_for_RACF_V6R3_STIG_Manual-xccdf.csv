Verify that the accesses to the CA Common Services installation data sets are properly restricted.  If the following guidance is true, this is not a finding.

___	The RACF data set rules for the data sets restricts READ access to all authorized users.

___	The RACF data set rules for the data sets restricts WRITE and/or greater access to systems programming personnel.

___	The RACF data set rules for the data sets specify that all (i.e., failures and successes) WRITE and/or greater access is logged.

___	The RACF data set rules for the data sets specify UACC(NONE) and NOWARNING.","The IAO will ensure that WRITE and/or greater access to CA Common Services installation data sets is limited to System Programmers only, and all WRITE and/or greater access is logged.  READ access can be given to all authorized users.

The installing Systems Programmer will identify and document the product data sets and categorize them according to who will have WRITE and/or greater access and if required that all WRITE and/or greater access is logged.  He will identify if any additional groups have WRITE and/or greater access for specific data sets, and once documented he will work with the IAO to see that they are properly restricted to the ACP (Access Control Program) active on the system.

Data sets to be protected may begin with:
SYS2.CCS.
SYS2A.CCS.
SYS3.CCS.
