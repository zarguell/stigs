The following PROCLIB data set will NOT be used or evaluated:

Recommendation for sites:

The following are recommendations for the sites to ensure only PROCLIB data sets that contain the STC and TSO procedures are protected.

-Remove all application PROCLIB data sets from MSTJCLxx and JES2 procedures. The customer will have all JCL changed to use the JCLLIB JCL statement to refer to the application PROCLIB data sets.

Example:

//USERPROC JCLLIB ORDER=(SYS4.USERPROC)

-Remove all access to the application PROCLIB data sets and only authorize system programming personnel WRITE and/or greater access to these data sets.

-Document the application PROCLIB data set access for the customers that require WRITE and/or greater access. Use this documentation as justification for the inappropriate access created by the scripts.

-Change MSTJCLxx and JES2 procedure to identify STC and TSO PROCLIB data sets separate from application PROCLIB data sets. The following is a list of actions that can be performed to accomplish this recommendation:

a. Ensure that MSTJCLxx contains only PROCLIB data sets that contain STC and TSO procedures.
b. If an application PROCLIB data set is required for JES2, ensure that the JES2 procedure specifies more than one PROCxx DD statement concatenation or identified in the JES2 dynamic PROCLIB definitions. Identify one PROCxx DD statement data set concatenation that contains the STC and TSO PROCLIB data sets. Identify one or more additional PROCxx DD statements that can contain any other PROCLIB data sets. The concatenation of the additional PROCxx DD statements can contain the same data sets that are identified in the PROCxx DD statement for STC and TSO. The following is an example of the JES2 procedure:

//JES2 PROC 
//IEFPROC EXEC PGM=HASJES20,PARM=NOREQ, 
//DPRTY=(15,15),TIME=1440,PERFORM=9 
//ALTPARM DD DISP=SHR, 
//DSN=SYS1.PARMLIB(JES2BKUP) 
//HASPPARM DD DISP=SHR, 
//DSN=SYS1.PARMLIB(JES2PARM) 
//PROC00 DD DSN=SYS3.PROCLIB,DISP=SHR 
//DD DSN=SYS2.PROCLIB,DISP=SHR
//DD DSN=SYS1.PROCLIB,DISP=SHR 
//PROC01 DD DSN=SYS4.USERPROC,DISP=SHR 
//DD DSN=SYS3.PROCLIB,DISP=SHR 
//DD DSN=SYS2.PROCLIB,DISP=SHR 
//DD DSN=SYS1.PROCLIB,DISP=SHR 
//IEFRDER DD SYSOUT=* 
//HASPLIST DD DDNAME=IEFRDER

c. Ensure that the JES2 configuration file is changed to specify that the PROCLIB entry for the STC and TSU JOBCLASSes point to the proper PROCxx entry within the JES2 procedure or JES2 dynamic PROCLIB definitions that contain the STC and/or TSO procedures. All other JOBCLASSes can specify a PROCLIB entry that uses the same PROCxx or any other PROCxx DD statement identified in the JES2 procedure or identified in the JES2 dynamic PROCLIB definitions. The following is an example of the JES2 initialization parameters:

JOBCLASS(*) ACCT=NO, /* ACCT # NOT REQUIRED (DEF.)*/ 
...
PROCLIB=01, /* DEFAULT TO //PROC01 DD (DEF.)*/
...
JOBCLASS(STC) AUTH=ALL, /* ALLOW ALL COMMANDS (DEF.)*/

...
JOBCLASS(TSU) AUTH=ALL, /* ALLOW ALL COMMANDS (DEF.)*/
...

These emergency ACID(s) will have ability to access and update all system data sets but will not have security administration privileges. See the following requirements:

Data set permissions for the emergency ACIDs will be permitted as follows:

TSS PER(acid) DSN(*****) ACCESS(ALL) ACTION(AUDIT)

Security Bypass Attributes NODSNCHK, NOVOLCHK, and NORESCHK will not be given to the Emergency ACIDs.

All emergency ACID(s) are to be implemented with logging to provide an audit trail of their activities.

All emergency ACID(s) are to be maintained in both the ESM and SYS1.UADS to ensure they are available in the event that the ESM is not functional.

All emergency ACID(s) will have distinct, different passwords in SYS1.UADS and in the ACP, and the site is to establish procedures to ensure that the passwords differ. The password for any ID in SYS1.UADS is never to match the password for the same ID in the ACP.

All emergency ACID(s) will have documented procedures to provide a mechanism for the use of the IDs. Their release for use is to be logged, and the log is to be maintained by the ISSO. When an emergency ACID is released for use, its password is to be reset by the ISSO within 12 hours.

1) Review the access authorizations for all emergency ACIDs to ensure that all access permitted to these ACIDs is reviewed and approved by the ISSO.
2) If emergency ACIDs are utilized, ensure they are restricted to performing only the operating system recovery functions or the ESM administration functions.

If these emergency ACID(s) have ability to ACCESS and UPDATE all system data sets, but do not have security administration privileges, this is not a finding.

The FTP Server can provide audit data in the form of SMF records. SMF record type 119, the TCP/IP Statistics record, can be written with the following subtypes:

70 - Append
70 - Delete and Multiple Delete
72 - Invalid Logon Attempt
70 - Rename
70 - Get (Retrieve) and Multiple Get
70 - Put (Store and Store Unique) and Multiple Put

SMF data produced by the FTP Server provides transaction information for both successful and unsuccessful FTP commands. This data may provide valuable information for security audit activities. Type 119 records use a more standard format and provide more information.","V-98655,SV-107759,CCI-000067,CCI-002884"

Spooling products users (CA-SPOOL, CA View, etc.) will be restricted to localnodeid.userid.jobname.jobid.dsnumber.name, whether generic and/or masked when approved by the ISSO. Logging of access is not required.","Configure the following items to be in effect for JESSPOOL resources. The JESSPOOL may have more restrictive security at the direction of the ISSO.

The JESSPOOL resources may be fully qualified, be specified as generic, or be specified with masking as indicated below:

localnodeid.userid.jobname.jobid.dsnumber.name

localnodeid - The name of the node on which the SYSIN or SYSOUT data set currently resides.
userid - The userid associated with the job. This is the userid used for validation purposes when the job runs.
jobname - The name that appears in the name field of the JOB statement.
jobid - The job number JES2 assigned to the job.
dsnumber - The unique data set number JES2 assigned to the spool data set. A D is the first character of this qualifier.
name - The name of the data set specified in the DSN= parameter of the DD statement. If the JCL did not specify DSN= on the DD statement that creates the spool data set, JES2 uses a question mark (?).

All users must have access to their own JESSPOOL resources. Permission can be granted by resource permission JESSPOOL(localnodeid.%.) ACCESS(ALL). This permission can be given to profiles, individual user, and/or the ALL record. Access to this resource does not require logging.

Example:
TSS ADDTO(deptacid) JESSPOOL(localnode.)
TSS PERMIT(ALL) JESSPOOL(localnode.%.) ACCESS(ALL)

The localnodeid. resource will be restricted to only system programmers, operators, and automated operations personnel, with access of ALL. All access will be logged. (localnodeid. resource includes all generic and/or masked permissions, example: localnodeid.**, localnodeid.*, etc.)

Example:
TSS PERMIT(syspsmpl) JESSPOOL(localnodeid.) ACCESS(ALL) ACTION(AUDIT)

The JESSPOOL localnodeid.userid.jobname.jobid.dsnumber.name, whether generic and/or masked, can be made available to users, when approved by the ISSO. Access will be identified at the minimum access for the user to accomplish the users function. All access will be logged. An example is team members within a team, providing the capability to view, help, and/or debug other team member jobs/processes. If frequent situations occur where users working on a common project require selective access to each other's jobs, then the installation may delegate to the individual users the authority to grant access, but only with the approval of the ISSO.

Example:
TSS PERMIT(Project1-profile) JESSPOOL(localnodeid.UMO) ACCESS(ALL)

If IBM's SDSF product is installed on the system, resources defined to the JESSPOOL resource class control functions related to jobs, output groups, and SYSIN/SYSOUT data sets on various SDSF panels.

CSSMTP will not be granted to the JESSPOOL resource of the high level ""node."" or ""localnodeid."". CSSMTP can have access to the specific approved JESSPOOL resources, minimally qualified to the ""node.userid."" and all access will be logged. This will ensure system records who (userid) sent traffic to CSSMTP, when and what job/process.

Spooling products users (CA-SPOOL, CA View, etc.) will be restricted to localnodeid.userid.jobname.jobid.dsnumber.name, whether generic and/or masked when approved by the ISSO. Logging of access is not required.

The ISSO will review JESSPOOL resource rules. If a rule has been determined not to have been used within the last two years, the rule will be removed.","SV-107799,V-98695,CCI-000213"

If no XA ACID entries exist in the above reports, this is not applicable.

For each ACID identified in the XA ACID entries, if the following items are true regarding ACID permissions, this is not a finding.

-ACID permission (XA ACID) is logged (ACTION = AUDIT), only for Privileged USERIDS (MASTER, SCA, DCA, VCA, ZCA) if they are XAUTH; at the discretion of the ISSM/ISSO scheduling tasks may be exempted from logging.

-Access authorization is restricted to scheduling tools, started tasks, or other system applications required for running production jobs.

Other users may have minimal access required for running production jobs with documentation properly approved and filed with the site security official (ISSM or equivalent). 

Consider the following recommendations when implementing security for Cross-Authorized ACIDs:

Keep ACID cross authorization of ACIDs outside of those granted to the scheduling software to a minimum number of individuals.

The simplest configuration is to have no ACID Cross Authorization except for the appropriate Scheduling task/software for production scheduling purposes as documented.

Temporary Cross Authorization of the production batch ACID to the scheduling tasks may be allowed for a period for testing by the appropriate specific production Support Team members. Authorization, eligibility, and test period is determined by site policy.

Access authorization is restricted to the minimum number of personnel required for running production jobs. However, ACID Cross Authorization usage must not become the default for all jobs submitted by individual userids (i.e., system programmer will use their assigned individual userids for software installation, duties, whereas a Cross-Authorized ACID would normally be utilized for scheduled batch production only and as such must normally be limited to the scheduling task such as CONTROLM) and not granted as a normal daily basis to individual users.

Grant access to the user ACID for each cross-authorized ACID required:

For each module identified in the ""eyecatcher"" that has BYPASS Password Protection, No data set Integrity, an elevated Privilege Key, or any combination thereof, determine if there is a valid loaded module. Again, you may use a third-party product; otherwise, execute the following steps:
 From an ISPF command line

 Press Enter.

 If the return message is ""Load Failed"", make sure there is an entry in PARMLIB member SCHEDxx that revokes the excessive privilege. 

If this is not true, this is a finding.","Review the PPT and define all entries associated with nonexistent or inapplicable modules as invalidated. Nullify the invalid IEFSDPPT entry by ensuring that there is a corresponding SCHED entry, which confers no special attributes. 

Use the following recommendations and techniques to provide protection for the PPT:

Review the IEFSDPPT module and all programs that IBM has, by default, placed in the PPT to validate their applicability to the execution system. Refer to the IBM z/OS MVS Initialization and Tuning Reference documentation for the version and release of z/OS installed at the individual site for the actual contents of the default IEFSDPPT. 

Modules for products not in use on the system will have their special privileges explicitly revoked. Do this by placing a PPT entry for each module in the SYS1.PARMLIB(SCHEDxx) member, specifying no special privileges. The PPT entry for each overridden program will be in the following format, accepting the default (unprivileged) values for the sub parameters:

PPT PGMNAME(<program name>)

Assemble documentation regarding these PPT entries, and the ISSO will keep it on file. Include the following in the documentation:

-The product and release for which the PPT entry was made

During initialization, the TCP/IP stack uses fixed search sequences to locate the PROFILE.TCPIP and TCPIP.DATA files. However, uncertainty is reduced and security auditing is enhanced by explicitly specifying the locations of the files. In the TCP/IP started task's JCL, Data Definition (DD) statements can be used to specify the locations of the files.

The location of the TCPIP.DATA file can also be specified by coding the RESOLVER_CONFIG environment variable as a parameter of the ENVAR option in the TCP/IP started task's JCL. In fact, the value of this variable is checked before the SYSTCPD DD statement by some processes. However, not all processes (e.g., TN3270 Telnet Server) will access the variable to get the file location.

-There are no TSS rules that allow access to the BPX resource.
-There are no TSS rules for BPX.SAFFASTPATH defined.
-The TSS rules for each of the BPX resources listed in the z/OS UNIX System Services Planning, Establishing UNIX security, restrict access to appropriate system tasks or systems programming personnel.","Because they convey especially powerful privileges, the settings for BPX.DAEMON, BPX.SAFFASTPATH, BPX.SERVER, and BPX.SUPERUSER require special attention. 

Review the following items for the IBMFAC resource class: 

-The TSS owner defined for the BPX resource. 
-There are no TSS rules that allow access to the BPX resource. 
-There are no TSS rules for BPX.SAFFASTPATH defined. 

The TSS rules for each of the BPX resources listed in General Facility Class BPX Resources Table, in the z/OS UNIX System Services Planning, Establishing UNIX security restrict access to appropriate system tasks or systems programming personnel. Access can be permitted only to users with a requirement for the resource that is documented to the ISSO. Access to BPX.DAEMON must be restricted to the z/OS UNIX kernel userid, z/OS UNIX daemons (e.g., inetd, syslogd, ftpd), and other system software daemons (e.g., web servers). When BPX.SAFFASTPATH is defined, calls to the ACP are not performed for file accesses and there is no audit trail of access failures. This configuration is unacceptable. Therefore BPX.SAFFASTPATH must not be used on any system. 

For Example:
The following commands can be used to provide the required protection:

TSS ADD(ADMIN) IBMFAC(BPX.)
TSS PERMIT(ALL) IBMFAC(BPX.SAFFASTPATH) ACCESS(NONE)

NOTE:
The PERMIT command for BPX.SAFFASTPATH must be executed on TOP SECRET systems. If access to BPX.SAFFSTPATH were allowed, z/OS UNIX would perform permission bit checking internally instead of calling the ACP. On TOP SECRET systems this would bypass any audit trail of violations. In addition, the z/OS UNIX kernel userid (OMVS is the example in this section) must not have the TOP SECRET NORESCHK privilege. Having that privilege would allow access to BPX.SAFFASTPATH even though the access restriction was in place.","SV-107963,V-98859,CCI-000213"

The data sets to be protected are identified in the data set referenced in the CSFPARM DD statement of the ICSF started task(s) and/or batch job(s); the entries for CKDSN and PKDSN specify the data sets. If the following guidance is true, this is not a finding.

If the TSS data set access authorizations do not restrict READ access to auditors, this is a finding.

If the TSS data set access authorizations do not restrict WRITE and/or greater access to systems programming personnel, this is a finding.

If the TSS data set access authorizations do not  restrict WRITE and/or greater access to the product STC(s) and/or batch job(s), this is a finding.","The ISSO will ensure that WRITE and/or greater access to IBM Integrated Crypto Service Facility (ICSF) STC and/or batch data sets are limited to system programmers and ICSF STC and/or batch jobs only. READ access can be given to auditors at the ISSO's discretion.

The installing systems programmer will identify and document the product data sets and categorize them according to who will have what type of access and if required which type of access is logged. The installing systems programmer will identify any additional groups requiring access to specific data sets, and once documented the installing systems programmer will work with the ISSO to see that they are properly restricted to the ACP (Access Control Program) active on the system.

(Note: The data sets and/or data set prefixes identified below are examples of a possible installation. The actual data sets and/or prefixes are determined when the product is actually installed on a system through the product's installation guide and can be site specific.)

The data sets to be protected are identified in the data set referenced in the CSFPARM DD statement of the ICSF started task(s) and/or batch job(s); the entries for CKDSN and PKDSN specify the data sets.

Note: Currently on most CSD systems, the CKDSN specifies SYS3.CSF.CKDS and PKDSN specifies SYS3.CSF.PKDS.

The following commands are provided as a sample for implementing data set controls:
