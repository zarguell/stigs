As of vSphere 6.5 this transfer can be transparently encrypted using 256bit AES-GCM with negligible performance impact. vSphere 6.5 enables encrypted vMotion by default as 'Opportunistic', meaning that encrypted channels are used where supported but the operation will continue in plain text where encryption is not supported.
