Verify the BIG-IP APM module is configured as follows:

Click ""Edit..."" in the ""Access Policy"" column for an Access Profile used for organizational access.

Verify the Access Profile is configured to automatically terminate user sessions when organization-defined conditions or trigger events occur that require a session disconnect.
