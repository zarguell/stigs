Due to the unique file structure of the TMC and Audit data sets, CA 1 uses the YSVC programs to handle all direct I/O activity. Because standard OPEN/CLOSE macros are not used, typical data set security checks are not performed. Even if a user does not have read authority to these data sets, the YSVC programs can enable that user to read and update records within these files. Therefore, control READ access to the TMC and Audit data sets by the YSVCUNCD and YSVCCOND resource names. Typical users should be restricted to conditional READ access.

Restrict CA 1 batch production jobs, and CA 1 started tasks to the following access authority:  Unconditional READ and UPDATE access to the TMC, Audit, Retention, and Vault Pattern Description data sets. NOTE: READ and UPDATE access to the TMC and Audit data sets are controlled by the YSVCUNCD and YSVCCOND resource names, and by standard ACP data set controls, because some CA 1 utilities use conventional OPEN/CLOSE methods.

CA 1 external security utilizing RACF is accomplished in the manner described in this section.

NOTE:       The TMOOPTxx member is specified in the TMOSYSxx member in the data set allocated by the TMSPARM DD statement in the TMSINIT STC. By default, the suffix 00 is used for these members. However, overrides can be specified by PARM value(s) on the EXEC statement in the TMSINIT STC and/or in the TMOSYSxx member.

Review the options and values of the below CA 1 parameters. If the options are set to the specified value, this is not a finding.

Note 1       The CREATE parameter defines the level of access that is required to create a data set on tape. The default value is UPDATE. However, the vendor recommends the value be set to CREATE if you are running CA Top Secret or ACF2 and ALTER if you are running RACF.
Note 2       The FUNC option provides supplementary security for BLP access. The tape label bypass privilege must still be specified in the RACF userid record to allow access to BLP processing.

Note 3       The vendor recommends that OCEOV be set to NO and the RACF SETROPTS option TAPEDSN be active. Be advised that if OCEOV is disabled and RACF TAPEDSN is not active, tape data set protection will not be in effect.
